i came to london to study at ucl i came to london from new york i came to london to study philosophy in particular i'm studying for my m fill a ucl i part of why i came to london also is the city itself it's a very interesting big city and coming from new york i wanted to live in another city that was interesting to me and had a lot of culture a lot of museums a lot of music going on art scenes so i came for school first but beyond that the ability to live a life that i found interesting i like about london the fact that there is a lot going on i like the amount of parks there are actually is one of my favorite things living in new york there is really only two big parks well there are a few big parks but the two biggest parks i would frequent where central park and prospect park outside of that you just have very tiny park some the size of a parking lot so what i like about one is i live close to hampson heath of close to regions park as well and i can frequent those massive parks very easily beyond that there's a lot of other parks to though even just in the north we have victoria park we have others as well so i like being outside in london i like exploring i like taking pictures in the parks taking going to concerts going to shows going to museums what do i dislike about london i just like the weather sometimes i'm i rains a lot in london as you might now so i just like the the idea that it's all like i wake up and it's raining and i go to bed it's raining and sometimes it's very gloomy and that can be a little bit depressing to not see the sun very often which an issue the issue of nothing the sun very often is exacerbated by there being very short days during the winter once it turns into daylight savings time it's dark by four pm completely pitch back by five pm at the latest i'd say four thirty pm and when it's reading outside all day and i don't wake up often i don't wake up to about eleven o'clock on the side of school and really my closest my earliest day is eleven pm so i'm on our house by ten so there you know it's only five hours and then when you have class you have work the days go by very quickly and you don't see a lot of the son and i do miss that so that's one thing i dislike about london to a favor my favorite restaurant is not available in london my favorite restaurant is actually my dad's restaurant he owns italian restaurant in north carolina in the united states and it's not available on london obviously but my favorite type of cuisine is certainly available in london have a few different i once have one particular type of cuisine that's my favorite i like well i cook a lot actually so that's all available one and i could call out with tofu echo called vegetables cook meat very much so yeah that's that's all that is available and i just don't utilize it but i do like to go to restaurants i don't have a particularly favorite though i would say that there's anyone that's my favorite i've been to any parts of yes i've been to a lot of parcel in my favorite park is here two parks or regions and hampson heath i'd say that my favorite between those two is hampson he has a little bit more of a queen as to it regents feels like it's too organized for me regions park it's very nice
