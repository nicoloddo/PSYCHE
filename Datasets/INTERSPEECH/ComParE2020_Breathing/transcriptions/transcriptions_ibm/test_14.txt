i came to london about six years ago to study i had finished my high school studies and i once come to university so i did two years of what they call sixth form here in which i did a math physics and economics after that i went to university in another part of london in north part of england and so i left london for a few years and then now come back to work and finish up my studies one of things the few things that i do like about london is the level of diversity that london brings london is a multimalk pot with people from different cultures from different countries and funny things everything works here in london people get along with each other there was a sense of community and there's a sense of understanding even though people are probably not going to talk to you in the streets but if you need help there's a high chance that they will help you and i just really love that sense of spirit and lessons understanding and some of the things i do not like while london is it is just too expensive the city is so expensive it feels like every time i breathe this money coming out of my pocket when i'm an account it is not the best another thing that i do know like my london is when traveling on the tube during peak times or rush hour is just so full people have really time compared to breath but then again it ties back to the understanding that everyone understands that this is what you have to go through to live in this wonderful city so one of my favorite restaurants in london would have to be benihana and they have three and occasions in st paul's picadilly and in chelsea i love beniana because the japanese food and absolutely love japanese food the seasoning the fresh fish the sushi the beef the tariaki sauce is just absolutely amazing it's well it's everything i can eat it every day but we see expensive so i can't and when it comes to parks in london i haven't been to that many parts of london a bin to hide park and i've been to read this park and these are really nice parts in the summer you can sit down have a meal just look at the view and just take it all in to really really great experience between the two i think i would probably go for high park just because you can get to herrods quite fast i think it's hard harrison we did park as well yeah i've never done it but i think you should be able to because they're quite close to each other so if i if someone you came to london and had to recommend somewhere for them to go wow i would probably recommend you know the terrorist attraction such as buckingham palace and big band i see hyde park just for them to be on the night i should shared just for them kind of sea london toys perspective into experience the culture the london has to offer i'd also take some terrorists on the not so toys the parts but parts that have such great street food such as an area shortage hackney i shouldn't canada wolf as well because that's really really nice like the business district of london roll the bake so the big corporations answer the big big banks are located and i haven't been to that many substructions myself london just because i don't know if i when you live here you always have this thing that's you had they know i could always go so i bother groups today but i haven't been to any but i
