so i moved to london just over a year ago now to start a postoc job at ecl i guess i applied for a few different jobs and this is the one i got i initially wasn't that sure about moving to london because whenever i'd been here before it was often seemed quite big and intimidating and you know when you get the tube and then you come out for tube and you have no idea what direction you're facing or what exit you should go out of and you have to start walking for google maps leaving kind of catch up and tow which direction you're going in and that was kind of my experience of london of being disoriented and lost and i don't think it really helped that i spent a lot of time in the slightly like less nice parts of london because a lot of my friends moved here after we finished undergraduate and obviously no already had any money and a lot of them are still doing further study and stuff so they kind of lived in miles away parts of london like i guess burman see or shepherds bush market and stuff and so it's been a lot of time traveling just to get from one place to another or you'd go out with some friends and then you'd have to get like four night buses back to someone's flat where you could stay for the night or waiting for the bus back to oxford wars living at the time that's three o four in the morning from like notting hill and that's kind of intimidating and so i think i always got this impression of london is kind of quite cold and unfriendly and also somewhere where it's really inconvenient to get anywhere but i think actually just that at the time a lot of the people i knew lived in inconvenient places and well i guess that's obviously makes sense when you consider their students but most of london's not really like that and there are parts of london even though they're cheaper they're also a lot nicer and easier to get around to whereas i would not say west london is particularly always like that i think some of the things i like most ralendon are just that there's always something going on um there's always like a museum or an art gallery or a show that you've not seen and it's kind of nice to be able to wake up or morning and not have any plans in particular of what you want to do but still be able to find something really interesting that you'll really enjoy and not to patch like planet weeks or months in advance or for it to be like the same thing that you've done and seen before so that's one of the things i really like i also kind of like how i see more of my family them before because they come from near london say they're able to visit me off me more often although it does mean that my young guest sister kind of tends to turn up and it's like oh by the way can i stay with you tonight and i'm like yeah sure but maybe some notice would have been helpful yeah but i mean i guess she's kind of at that point in her life where she's just expirenting and visiting friends and forward planning isn't as important to her but it is nice even when she just turns up unexpectedly even if it's a bit stressful to like find some i've heard sleep or like um i don't know make sure she gets whatever trained she needs in the next morning it is nice that she feels that she can just turn up and be welcome and i think some of the things i don't really like by london how polluted it is i mean you can can't really see it and i don't think i've actually felt any effects of it but every soft and you have these like news bbc news articles or whatever come out that say the like most pollutive places in the city blooms reason pretty bad central london's pretty bad the tubes really bad and whilst you can't see the effect that has on your healthy kind of worry that maybe it is or maybe it will a few years down the line some of my family has asthma so it's kind of always a bit of a concern
