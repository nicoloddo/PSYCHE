okay so things that i like favorite restaurant electrically favorite restaurant i went to sketch the other day which has an amazing ambience and ethereal ambiences if you're in another world as each room has a different color and different amazing decor so the orientalist section makes you feel a bit that you're actually in china and then them lose the toilets are amazing because they like like space polls so you go upstairs to separate section it if you're entering into a different universe you could say we all these the toilets in the form of white pubs also what i like what the restaurant it was so tasty very very incredible the best what i think the best c pan fried see best which is smokes i've ever tried in my life so the food is absolutely amazing to service was also very polite for a spot on so anybody can go and it's a modern british cuisine you could say so european fair and anybody can go and book in the different restaurants okay so some things i like about london the fact that it's there's a lot of things to do the sorts of culture pursuits you could never they say you could never be bored in a place like london what you do do not like about it it's not a very relaxing place to read it's quite aggressive so if you want to have relaxation it's better to live outside of london and then to come inside to london if you have to work figure parks do i have a favorite favorite park i like call height park work during the winter one the land time because it has all these amazing activities to do and gives a very christmas sort of feel any too instructions i like i think the taravelon is the best tourist attraction is to spend the whole day and then when there's lots of things to see lots of interactives to take part in and you get the very tasty sausage roles and sausage and pies over there i find as well someone to knew would you recommend so i recommend they go see terrified them i recommend if they want to go on a tour you can go in an afternoon t london boss that takes you round while serving you on off to what it's a cold b and b's bakery i think i'd recommend you go and hang out in coven garden to see older the energy in the vibe and older theatrical performances in the cute independent shops that still are in covent garden i'd recommend to go to greenwich which is like a hidden part of london people don't go out to see so much you get the best vantage from easy greenwich merging line you quote walk up the hill to the astronomy museum and you can have the best view of london and then also experience maritime london where going to the cutty sock an old tea clipper ship and it feels like you're in continental europe not really like in london so that's a nice place to see
