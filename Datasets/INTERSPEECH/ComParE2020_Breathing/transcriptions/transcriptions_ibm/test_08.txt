cool so i came to london for a job i'm at e c l i was very happy my last job and this one came up just at the right time and it's worth made sense because my partner is done here my family live close to london so it's all seen like the right time to finally bite the bullet and move which is very exciting i like the fact that there's lots of things to do in london that's lots of culture source of music are free out to go to loss of museums you'll never stuck for things to do i like the fact that there's things i'll always open as well i'm not everything shuts at five clock like at my home town and that's good but i thought things that don't like that london i don't like the fact that it's so busy is so expensive that was a really big shock after coming back living in biominging for so long and that everything is probably like double the price and you can pay eight pounds for point which is ludicrous i try and avoid the tubes during russia because it's so busy as well and when i do have to take the chief that's pretty pretty horrendous and people on this friendly as when you're out of the sticks because there's people everywhere whereas you might not see people for ages miles if you go out for a walk out in the countryside because that's a bit annoying i love the fact that i live up in north london in quiet turkish area so there is a really good turkish restaurant which is one of the good things about london as well i have noticed so multi cultural so that means that there's lots of lots of good food and their restaurants are really cheap where i live as well so that's pretty good but you have to be careful because of ways it can be quite expensive if you go to the wrong places and central which is a bit annoying and there's lots of parks near me as wow so finishery park is not that far away from me which is quite convenient but you see some strange things there i saw someone practicing their drum just on the grouth when i was walking home once and probably didn't wanna cause too much noise and to start the house mates so far enough but probably not your usual instrument of choice i've also been to high park as well and i don't go there that often and there's a few sort of more local parks near where i am where they put on quite a few events as well so that's nice so if someone was new to the city i would suggest that they go to the welcome trust because there's all sorts of weird medical stuff there which is really good the tape modern's always good all day something lots a bit weird depending on what sort of things you like i worried i haven't seen many of the tourists attractions despite the fact that i used to grow up fairly near london and i live there now so i've never been to london i i'm not really sure what the big fusses about and i don't know if i level really pay that much to go up there i've never already done the london dungeons or seen big ben i think i spend most of my time at bars and um the rest runs and sing music and stuff urm so i think there's a lot of things that i still have left to do but i think that's always going to be the case causes sort of too much too much today problem is this when you live in london this
