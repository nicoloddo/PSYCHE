so i moved to london for the first time in two thousand and fourteen at for my master's degree i studied social policy and development ad dalacy i was in london for a year but then afterwards moved to frankfort with my partner because he got a job there he's german we said in frankford for a year but then decided that it was a bit dell for us so we decided to move back to london in two thousand sixteen and i've been in london since then we quite like london it's an exciting city we like how cosmpolitan it is how you can find things to do at any time of day in any area we like the the range of cultures food cinema theater all of that and i think it's a really great city and have been a lot of interesting people from around the world however sometimes i find london a bit stressful it feels a bit isolating and dirty rent is extremely high given how though the salaries are but still still think it's a it's a fun city to be in while you're young particularly what i like about london is the diverse culture around cuisines that it has the other day went to ethiopian restaurant which i quite liked and i haven't had ethiopian food elsewhere before and in particular the cuisine that i think i like most is indian one of my favorite restaurants is dessume i go the regularly with my partner and a friend of ours we meet there maybe once or twice a month for breakfast on the weekends and it's really nice because it's become part of our a routine and a place to meet up with friends and enjoy nice meal my favorite parks in london i would say our victoria park and hackney downs so i live in hagani in stoke newton actually clissed old park as well um and think that's an important part of of what we do and how we get away from the busy life of the city i enjoy going to the parks and just watching people play basketball or football lying down reading taking a dog taking a nap victoria parking why like in the summer it's really full and bustlying in really big so you can just meander about for a long time i'm hackney downs is more local so it feels like it's really part of the community clisted park is really lovely as well it's very family rented so you can find dear and birds and goats i guess in horses or whatever which is also nice because it it also gives kind of a community feel i haven't really done touristy stuff in london for quite a long time when my partner and i moved back to london in two thousand sixteen we had a bunch of friends coming almost every weekend so we would take them to a lot of the tourists attractions london i south bank tate borough market a lot of stuff around this side of the city at the side of the river as well st pauls shortage brooklyn we almost had kind of a routine and would just walk around with our friends chad but also kind of lazily look around which is another nice thing about london is you can just amble about but your eye can still be interested in what you see architecturally kind of the people the graffiti all of that i think it's really it's really nice to walk around some of the stuff i would say is a bit overrated but i guess that's because i've done it so many times that it's no longer novel to me no
