uh as i moved to london in two thousand and ten when i started at university at ucl so first i studied speech and language therapy and i did the undergraduate program air which was four years i have said before that i lived in working which wasn't isn't too far away from london anyway and but after that i moved away from london for uhm another two years and moved back home to working and then moved back again in well about three years ago back to chisex now i live in london full time as there's some things i like about london i love that you can kind of do anything you want at any time you want and there's never a boring weekend there's always something more to go and see or to go and look at or that you haven't visited before even if you are revisiting things that you really like i also love that it's really easy and to get around town so there's loads of ways to travel i am on the overground and underground and on the buses so it's really easy turkey out and about a the other thing i love is that and they have lots of are vegan options in london so i became vegan in january this year and found that there's so many options available in and around london but these kind of reduce quite a lot when you go out of london so it's really great that to have the all these options available on your doorstep some things i don't like about london i hate my commute so i have to commute in from west london every day and it takes me about an hour each way and it's definitely the worst part of my day and i hate having to go home in the dark in the evening on the tube and then walk another ten minutes in the rain i'd love to live a bit closer and that i can't uh what else did i like about london it's really busy all of the time and you can't stand still anywhere cause there's always someone i'm trying to get past you but i also really like that aspect of london that it is busy and there's always a good atmosphere wherever you go erm i don't really have a favorite restaurant in london tend to eat in quite a few different places don't tend to go back to the same place but like i said i vegan so always are looking for new places to try but they typically tend to be in east london which is kind of annoying because i live in west london and so it's a little bit of a track there and to go and visit a few of those places if i met someone new in the city i'd probably recommend that they go and visit all the different kind of little suburbs in london so kind of north london is obviously really different from and south and east london and they've all got their own character and they're all own vibe going on so it be kind of a miss if you didn't go and see all of those different areas to get a real fill for the city and i say get out of central london get out of all the tourist traps and just go and see where people live and go and see some of the smaller areas and have a little wand around and you'll always find something interesting to do i haven't actually been to that many of the terrorist attractions i think i've been on the land and i about ten years ago and went to the london dungeons otherwise tend to try and avoid them cause they're always very busy and very expensive um london i was good maybe a little overrated maybe a little overpriced but it is an icon and so i can see why people would want to cover and have a go on it okay what i shall i talk about have i been to any of the parks in london and yeah i used to live on garage street so my local part used to be reading
