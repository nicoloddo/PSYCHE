so i've come to london for multiple reasons firstly i got married in september and my now husband works at here in london say i moved here to join him here but also i got a job here it ecl to work as a post stock which was lucky given my husband was here say so that was that was kids london's quite different i was in oxford before which is a much smaller city and i find london quite busy and quite overwhelming and but we live quite far out so michael went to hell which i've heard described is just really not very like london given it is in london it's very quiet and fills quite suburban and we have a village green and it's quite nice say i actually like being able to escape the center and travel back out to the quiet suburbs but come in for work and have the option to come in and have all the attractions of london close by but not too close we did think about moving further in so that my commute would be better but we decided we just liked it further out where it was a bit quieter and like me isn't too bad it's thirty five minutes door to door which is pretty good for london so i feel like we kind of have the best of both worlds in that way but there are there are lots of things i like about london to like there are a lot of concerts here which is nice like we didn't have so many back in oxford so it's cool to get to see bands i like much more easily and the food as well me and my husband quite like going to restaurant stickly he likes quite posh places so when his mum comes to visit we clarify and go somewhere nice in london she really likes her good food to so yeah we've been to quite a range of different places round where we are there's a lot of italian restaurants not quite sure why i think there's called a big italian community which it's probably my favorite term food so that's quite nice and so yeah we enjoy going out for for food quite a lot and the parks in london are called to we have quite a few round where we are but i like the fact that even in the center you have these quite big open spaces that you can go to i really like hide park for example that's really nice but most of them are a pretty nice so i definitely recommend those to people coming to london for the first time i think the parks are one of the best things about london but there's this kind of there's all sorts something i would probably recommend if someone was new to the city would be something called the wallest collection which is kind of like this old house where six centric old man used to live i think maybe he was an architectural something but he collected a lot of different things a lot of random bizarre things and they're all in this house and it's just a really interesting collection of objects and civil buildings kind of full thrown in together and that's quite cool and i'm not sure many people know about that so that's probably what i would recommend to someone it's a good if they when you say to london but i haven't really been to many of the other sort of big tourist attractions like that london i i do there i think they're just often so busy and a full of people that i tend to stay clear probably more i've been to tourist attractions in terms of shopping
