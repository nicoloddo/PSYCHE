well i'm in london because primarily that's where my work is i e and working at the uclear institute which is on grave in road near king's cross and but i i've lived in london previously as well so they used to work in finance and i moved here for the first time in two thousand and one after finishing university i live mostly in around south london so was initially in east college then in the clap and then in kennington so at the moment i'm living in oxford and i'm down in london usually three or four days a week mostly just coming down into paddington or into malibun and getting the cheaper cross to king's cross but i do the various groups of friends here who i don't see as often as i would like to but when i do then i'll i'll tend to go down to central london or over to victoria where quite a few of my friends work or maybe go and stay with friends in cannington when i'm at in london though i've got i've got four memories of london as well from from those previous times and my brother used to live in east london and quite a few of his friends are still in that area so i see them fairly often and quite often end up going to concerts in london sometimes with my my dad who's also interested in music and sings and so we'll go to chamber music concerts for example some of the things i like about london are the fact that it's it's got this very rich history and the signs of that all over the place there are different levels of of london being built on top of one another so there are glimpses of those those lower levels or those earlier levels if you look hard enough and i do like the the cosmopolitan nature of the city the diversity of the people here the different languages you can hear spoken and the different cuisines that you can find and the fact that there's always somewhere new to explore so they'll always be a whether it's a museum or another restaurant or another neighbourhood i also like to just get on a bus and sit at the front at the top and look above the shop front level and look at the roofs of the buildings which again can reveal some of the londons history things i don't like so much about london include the rickety nature of some of the infrastructure the heat on the underground and although i engage in this behaviour myself the fact that it is sometimes quite isolated people do their own thing you get on the tube and there's not much i contact i don't really notice it too much when i'm in london but when i'm away from london i'm more aware of what london misses from that perspective other things i don't like about london i'm gonna move on to the next question actually so do i have a favorite restaurant or cuisine and is it available in london i i don't think i have a particular favorite i do enjoy chinese food having lived in china for a while and i there's plenty of chinese food here in london whether you were in chinatown so ho area or elsewhere i've got fun memories of a greek cypriot restaurant in katherine north which had wonderful meza and great bread that they used to make there and that also i enjoy that because it reminds me of times when i've been in greece for example in cretor and i was also had had a good holiday in the salamic have i been to any of the parks here in london while i yeart have been to several of them i don't spend as much time in the the big central ones like high park green park and since james's park but there are some nice open spaces else where when i was living in dallas in fact and maybe this isn't a park but
