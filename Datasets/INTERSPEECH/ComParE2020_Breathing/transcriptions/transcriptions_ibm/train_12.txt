yeah so i moved to london to start a master's degree at university college london that was two years ago i think maybe a little less i studied cognitive nearer science at the icn which is by russell square i really enjoyed the course it was about a year it was a year i didn't like being poor because i didn't have any income which wasn't great and which kind of makes living in london quite difficult but i did manage to get through the year since then i've stayed in london i actually got a job still with university college london as a research assistant which i am still doing now my contract runs out in september and it's been enjoyable so far i'm working with e g i feel like i can probably leave it about that things so i like there there's a lot of good music in london there are some jazz bands are active at the moment that i've seen a bunch of and i'm always learning new ones i don't know in the course of seeing you bands and hearing about people playing with second groups that also have projects their own i've been to some jazz jams i've really enjoyed and seen players there and gone to know people that i really enjoy this some good ones in hackney these one worry very close to our used to live in archway there's a really good night down in like portabello road which is quite good one there's probably some really good things in the south but i don't really know about it i never go to south london things only gracious i like i suppose i got a lot of friends in london because i come from the other white which is hideously boring if you're over the age of about four and you've got a q above twenty so a lot of my friends from the other white have you the moved here or they've moved to similar cities in the south of the uk i've also got some friends from university that came to the uk for university and then stayed here and now live in london as well so it's quite fun going seeing them one of them is dj so i've been come to see him play a few times another one another one i didn't see for a long time and he he was married but then they're getting a divorce but he moved back to london for a while so i kept in touch with him for a bit and he's been sent off to glasgow through his work so i only seem very rarely i'm gonna see very soon at new years so that'll be quite nice i'll leave on there i really don't like i suppose yeah the transport in london the fact that it takes ages to get places i kinda don't like the mentality of a lot of i think people that are native to the uk that have moved to london and kind of fallen in love with it and they don't quite realize or remember what it was like being in their home town where they didn't hear about london all the time so you get this kind of strange mindset where people think that everything's fine and there's so much going on without realizing how bad certain parts of the uk can be or how badly they're doing compared to london and it's it's a really weird kind of cognitive dissidence which it's it's something interesting that i don't really feel like i've heard a lot of my friends talk about i always find it quite strange that they just kind of seem to forget everything outside of london now the here seem i guess recently i've really eaten a lot of noodles it seems and there are tons of great place
