i first came to london to start my mse and then to do my phd because i really wanted to work with someone here at ucl so i moved to london but it's not actually somewhere i ever wanted to move umm at first i found it really big because i grew up in quite small cities and things take a really long time to get to places but actually as i've lived here i've enjoyed it a lot more yeah i've found public transport here is is really good generally but once i started cycling in london that was really great because it's a lot faster to get to different places and there are some really good cycle routes to and from work for me i find it a bit more scary to cycle on routes that i don't know because there's a lot of traffic but it's generally really good and good to get some exercise i also quite like traveling on the bus rather than on the tube because it's much nicer to be above ground than underground and it's also really noisy on the tube i i don't really have a favorite restaurant in london but i there are some really nice ones um particularly ethiopian food which i'm going to tonight i'm looking forward to um yeah there are there are lots of different styles of food we also like to go to efficient place quite near us that has really good quality fish and also great hello me which is really good yeah yeah i really like the area of london that i'm in i think my my favourite bit is hamstered heath and going to places like kenward house because you can sort of escape london a little bit and get to somewhere a bit quieter and there are really great views of london from there that if you climb up the hill especially in the evening it's really nice to climb up the hill and just look over the city when the lights go on yeah really good views and actually from the top of hampshire heath as well there's great panorama's of of all of the city but you feel nicely removed from the city which is really good and also at kenwit house they have really good tea and scones and yeah it's just a really nice place to walk and see lots of people with their dogs and they have good lakes there as well and places that you can swim in well some people swim their all the around which seems a bit mad and freezing cold i've swung there once in the summer on a boiling hot day in the middle of a very hot summer and it was so cold my hands sort of cramped up so i don't know quite how they manage it in the middle of winter but there are people who swim in sort of all year but it does get really busy in the summer particularly when it's hot and that's a really fun thing to do in london so that's definitely the place i take visitors when they come and see me in london is actually not to the sort of classic sites like the london i or anything really in the centre maybe because lots of my friends aren't massively keen on big cities or loads of people um so we tend to go walking instead in places that are a little bit quieter
