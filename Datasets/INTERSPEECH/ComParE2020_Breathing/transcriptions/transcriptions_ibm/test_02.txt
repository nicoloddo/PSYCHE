some things that i don't like about london is how busy and crowded is always i don't like how packed it is on the trains in the mornings and londoners can be pretty rude i don't like that there is not a lot of varied things to do in london it seems like there are lots of fun things to do and lots of different things we can do in london but everything is so expensive so it's very difficult i have a favourite restaurant in london and it's a malaysian restaurant i go there quite a lot with my partner and we i always order the exact same thing every single time it's a restaurant that is in china town and the food that i always order is a vegetable curry it's quite spicy and i quite like spice and whenever we go it seems very busy but we always end up sharing a table with strangers which can be quite an enjoyable experience um whenever we go there i always can never finish my food so they give me a nice that will take away box and i can then experience the same food again the next day which is great i have been to many parks in london i've been to the big one so hide park a regents park but my favourite park to go to is victoria park which is in east london and that park is my favourite because there's always lots of docs and whenever i go there i usually go to run and i can always stop and pet some dogs which is great in the park they also have a big fountain and a lake and in the summer you can hire out the little boats which was a disaster the last time i tried it because i don't know how to row a boat um and when i was at the park and i tried to row the boats the fountain in the middle meant that the boat kept being pulled towards the centre of the fountain which was very difficult to then steer the boat and all the people who were coming up to also try out the boats were all pointing and laughing which was great fun this park is also special because i used to go there with one of my answer when i was really small and there was also a big playground there when i was a kid and we used to always go there every weekend when it was warm enough and play on this on the equipment at the park they used to be this huge pirate ship that you could climb on which was my favorite there are also lots of squirrels and we used to take nuts and feed the squirrels which was really fun if i met someone who just came to london i would recommend that they they go to the theatre
