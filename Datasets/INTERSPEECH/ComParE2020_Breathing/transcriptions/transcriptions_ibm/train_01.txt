for what brings you to london to do a first to do a m rs here at the icn and then to do my phd here something as i like about london or is all all the stuff to do they just have really amazing museums that are completely free and so much music comes here that we can we can go and see that just is not accessible in and many other parts in the world people are generally like really really friendly and yeah it's just there's so much so much to do and so much to be exposed to and to learn but i don't like how horribly crowded it is and how it's just sometimes if you like it this constant overstimulation walking near leicester square is horrible and i try to avoid it at all times especially dying christmas when it's just especially crowded with tourists being on the northern line in the morning or right after work i try to skip that but either coming in by eight in the morning or coming in after ten because i really really hate being in someone else's armbit based on my size so that's definitely my least favorite thing also everything is covered in plastic like it's really hard to find fruits and vegetables that aren't aren't coded in that plastic so i'm trying trying to avoid that we got a new new box of fruits and vegetables that be like a lot more my favorite restaurant in london is definitely padella by in brown market because it's extremely good fresh pasta it's it's like the best that i've ever had and it's really cheap it's like five to seven pounds please depending on what you're getting so i can eat a ton of boston it's really delicious except it's really popular so i can only get in there for lunch because getting a dinner reservation you can't call the head you have to be there actually like stand there checking on the app and leave and it never works so can't be bothered but for lunch it's really really good so i bring lots of people to go there with me any of the parks in london i'm really close to ms heath so really familiar with that i like that one lot but in terms of general walking around it's a regions park is is nicer it has a lot more things to look at but running through him stead heathers is a lot more interesting because not just flat if i met someone new to the city well if they were if they were tourist i always have my friends go to the tower tour even though it's expensive it's really worth it because it's it's interesting and it's not something that you get to see anywhere else i also like going to q gardens if it's warm so those are its those are too really different thing is that i think it's more it to see that and i have a list of restaurants there that are nice tourist attractions i have been to the london i went there the first time that i came over with my end that was actually really cool i don't feel the need to do it again oh but i i enjoyed being on it so i i wouldn't i wouldn't say it's overrated just not necessary not necessary to do twice the vna is a big big tourist one that's really nice that they have a lot of really interesting glass work there that i enjoy seeing the room where you walk in it's all just hundreds of jesuses staring at you is kind of kind of odd but they have also really good traveling exhibits there i saw a solid and underwear that was nice that's right across the street from harrods which i do not recommend going to and avoid it all costs unfortunately anyone who wants to come visit always wants to go there so i try to say have a lot of work to do at that point and just not go because i hate i hate really hitting there but the catholic originally is also right there and that's a beautiful
