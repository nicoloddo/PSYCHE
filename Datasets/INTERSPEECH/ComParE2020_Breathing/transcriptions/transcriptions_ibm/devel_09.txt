i came to london and to do my undergrad degree following finishing my alebals i started a degree in by medical sciences there was a bsc at king's college london i was at the guys campus for about a term and then i dropped out and then the following week i submitted an application for university college london for archeology that was a bachelor of science so i came to london in september studied for three years doing my undergrad degree then i am took here out i worked full time at various cafes and then i started my masters in september my favorite things about london are that it's always busy and there's always something to do i am from a little village in the countryside in the middle of nowhere so moving to london was a big deal and it was sort of the complete opposite of where i grow up and i like how busy it is and there are so many options to do things i can i don't have to plan things to foreign advance i can spontaneously go out to the market or go see a park or museum or gallery i studied archaeology so i really like museums and i'm into art as well so i like the art galleries in london the tate modern is my favorite or the victoria and albert museum in south kensington i like the victoria and i'll be museum because there's a huge range of things to see lots of different materials something's i don't like about london all that it's really busy so i like it and i don't can be really stressful to just go and do things am simple things like going to the shops because of other people ummm i also hate it where tourists walk really slow on the pavement that's one of the worst things about london ummm my favourite restaurant is a hard to pick i have quite a few err one of my favorite restaurants to go to is flat i n it's in common garden and it just does stake there's only one thing really on the menu and then you choose your sides to go with it have been quite a few times with my brother my boyfriend i took my family there um you get free popcorn at the start of the meal you also get free ice cream on your way out which i love um but the only thing i don't like about the restaurant is that there are always massive a waiting times i love the parks in london i live in camden so regions park is really close as is promote hell i really like primos hill especially for a new year's eve i went the other week with my flatmates to watch the fireworks and do account down from the hill which was really fun i also like hampson heath i've been there quite a few times also been there swimming in the ponds my favorite park would have to be regents park just because i've spent more time there than the others if i met someone new to the city i would recommend that they go to the museums just because they're free and you get to see so much for no money especially around fibre square there are quite a few to see
