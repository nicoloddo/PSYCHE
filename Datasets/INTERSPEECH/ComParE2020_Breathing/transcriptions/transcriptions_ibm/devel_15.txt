okay so i'm done in london for work and i work i would do need to get i'm some done when in london for work and normally i work in new cars and that where i live but i am a i've got coming back a weird fituration where my fellowship up in new costs would meant to be hasted in london and i can only do the testing for the fellowship in london but you call to pay my salary though i live out and then they just give some money to you see all for me to do some work here which are quite nice because i'm from london originally so i get to see my family and friends and stuff but my expenses get paid by the university which is great some things i like about london so i really like the diversity of london and i've got so one of my friends that the they want one of my friends it really into like dressing really impressively i guess like i'm like properly like that sort of like a telecom modern instead of dandy with was elaborate like employee to end up and he always said the basically whenever he was in london he never felt like he stuck out that it was only other places that he felt like people were judging him for dressing weirdly so i really like that there basically like you can do whatever you want to do fit in and they also a lot of stuff going on in london generally like it some it's really easy to find something to do in the evening but i guess the things i don't like about london when i would live in here so i lived here for i guess where so i grew up here so i lived here until i with eighteen then i spent three years in the northeast of england i came back down here for my phd in my mother so i've been another five years in london and now i've moved to newcastle arm and so i've been a long time living in london and i got the thing is is that even though i said like that always something going on when i actually lived here i never actually went out and did on the fat stuff like occasionally i go out for dinner somewhere but like the kind of topic people do when they visit london like they go to the like the theater and stuff like that and i just never got around to it because i would always really exhausted i feel like the pace of life is generally like a lot more hectic in london and it's a lot more stressful like because it's so expensive to live in london you have to live further out from where you work which means you've been more time commuting and you just done that sort of generally being tired of at the end of a day it's what i found so you don't actually have the under to go out and do cool stuff i guess my favorite cuisine i go through sort of different phases of liking that i mean my son might be on salary at a massive food eight and really i just go through phases that he go through phases ever i'm not making different stuff and whatever he makes that my new thing that so you got ready to talk about it but actually there are some quite good taco places in london but i mean like that good tucker places all over i think and when i lived here probably my favorite place to go in it so i lived in phinble park on those like a little coffee shop cooperating in front park i used to really like going there for but
