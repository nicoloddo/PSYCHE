yeah what brings me to london i have lived in london since two thousand and eight when i came down my family from pool which is an area of england all the way down south its next to born meth it's super sunny as a rocky i think beech but born with reciprocal and some things you like about london i like how it's got multiple cultures in one erm i like the transport takes you everywhere you don't need a car i guess ah i like that all my friends are in london what are some things you don't like about london um well i went to one of the worst schools in south east london um so i have been chased by gangs that wasn't the most amazing time um other than that the whole crime aspect of london needs to be sorted out but yeah london's not bad at all do you have a favorite restaurant or cuisine no not all although i do like this one restaurant in the o two called jimmies believe its court jimmy's international just like this whole or you can eat buffet tight place um and it's decently cheap especially for being in the o two ah a few peans any of the parts in london no thing i've been to about two no no no if you met someone new to the city what would you recommend them goes see to be fair you despite living in london for so long i have not really been to any of the main attractions mainly because i just had no interest as did my friends although i would recommend them to go see the museums i guess uhm other than that just take some sort of bus tour of the city have you been to any tourist attractions uh the only one i've been to as a recent i think is the british museum um i kind of enjoyed it it was it wasn't overrated as a lot on display there then again there was a lot that they didn't show the about three sections were cut off and public uhm so just general questions then or topic i am currently doing my got the i'm essentially trying to conduct research into asmr which is the autonomous sensory meridian response um i'm interested in they as mar because it is something that has had a lack of scientific interest even of recent years there has only currently been four from rice alley is done on it and one physiological study focused on heart rate in school connections uh so doing another one would essentially kind of bolster the research base uhm then my terms i would link it to a sort of unexplored aspects of sound processing and in particular crossmodel processing within the auditory system and in particular again in the quarter orchestras where there is sort of onyx under explored spatial and smath century aspects of it in which a smart is a prime candidate to actually try and explore that further so that is the plan um i guess interests for myself would be gaming drawing sometimes painting sort of games i like open world mode rpg is just so i can spend a lot of time and send she escapes and from other stuff since the uni like going out my friends a lot normally do
