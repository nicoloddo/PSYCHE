okay well i would like to talk about as action my my recent christmas holiday because it's quite a interesting and and special in you and different one my partner i decided this year that we were just gonna take a few short days just exactly around the christmas dates to to go to vienna we had been on occur on a christmas holiday last year in germany for some of those christmas markers and we really loved it and we had read that vienna supposed to have actually one of the best christmas markets in all of europe and he was kind of around the summer that i was just looking at at christmas plans and and yeah vienna came up and actually there is a very interesting art exhibition that came up there displaying albert jurors the hair which is a very famous water color painting that is normally not on public display they were displaying it for four months including over christmas so that kind of sealed the deal we just went ahead and booked the flights on the middle of the summer quickly found a comedies we'd been to vienna once before and we knew where to stay excellent hostile there and yeah we booked that that room and it was for the twenty third to the twenty six are literally right over christmas it turns out that vienna's fantastic city to visit over christmas one of the reasons being that almost everything is actually open even on christmas day which i find is really quite unusual most in most cities even the big ones like you really can't find much to do at all on christmas day but no the vianies like to keep things open and so yeah we flew there on monday the twenty third immediately after checking and we went out to the christmas markets and honestly they were some of the most extraordinary christmas markets i had ever seen especially the the big one which is right in the the square where the town hall is it's it's pretty massive it's pretty colorful it's pretty large they even have an ice rink that has apparently three kilometers worth of skating not that we did this gating but it was really quite interesting to see and yeah just some really great food like some some really great grill sausages we had and and some progress and it was really fan it was really quite a spectacular place to be however the city actually has marcus throughout the city and we we covered a few of the other ones a few of the smaller ones i think my favorite one was the one just outside of the big cathedral there this is saint steve was done we got some really great actually that how that one had the best mald wine that of the whole city was one of the best mold wines i'd ever taste in my life and we had regard we got some really nice kind of souvenirs and gifts my partner bought a a nice water color painting of the the the town hall christmas market that we just been to and yeah it was just a really nice feel in the city these markets were even open on christmas e christmas day boxing day likewise the the exhibition that we were going to see that we went on christmas day the museum was open we also had a really lovely christmas dinner at at a kind of beer hall chain that you find throughout germany and and an austria august
