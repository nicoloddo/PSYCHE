Um, so I've been in London for the past two years and a bit. I was in Cambridge before that for a year. um, my wife is doing her PhD at ucl in neuroscience. She's at, um, the icn at Queens Square. When we first moved here, we moved to, um, camden Town. That was like a student housing. It was okay, it was cheap and big. It was really big for the London in Central, um, kind of grimy that had an awful blue carpet. But it wasn't a huge deal. um, and we had no control over the heat, so it was freezing cold in the wintertime. uh, and there were undergrads above us and around us. It wasn't a huge deal, but um, it was weird. We could hear in the bathroom, the undergrads, uh, partying in the kitchen above us. But it was strange because you could only really hear it in the bathroom. So we'd be sleeping in our bedroom in silence. We'd go to the bathroom and it'd be like this party club. Just funny. Anyway, they kick us out of there. We moved to a couple of other places since then. um, we were in kentish Town, which was cool. um, well, it was okay. We paid £1300 a month. It was way too much and it was like a tiny place and there were these awful people above us that were really obnoxious and loud. um, and the house was really small, the bathroom was tiny and the toilet was disgusting. We had a one year lease, but we broke it. ah, basically just saying the upstairs people were intolerable. And then we moved to highgate, which is where we are now. And it's equally small, but it's way cheaper. We're saving like £350 a month, which is amazing. M, and it's a quieter area, it's nice. I ride my bike to work, so it's not a huge deal. um, I guess in terms of the commute, um, I like London. There's always something to do in London and you can just sort of walk in random directions. There's lots you can enjoy on a day off and not have to think like, what should I do today in my small town? um, you don't have to spend a lot of money in London to have a nice time because you can walk around and see a lot of amazing things, even though obviously you can spend a lot of money in London. um, I like the history of it. I like the people, I like the diversity. People are really kind. um, yeah, it's sort of like down to earth, I find, except for the parts that are completely not down to earth. I guess there's just a lot of extremity in London. And I like all the burrows, I like all the, um, diversity, not just in the people, but in the feelings of the different boroughs where you kind of feel it. London feels like a lot of small towns kind of squished together, um, which I find really cool because you can get lots of different vibes, depending if you're wanting something more kind of quaint and cozy or something more business, corporate, or something more exciting. um, nightclub, gritty, whatever you want that's there. um, what I don't like about London, I mean, everyone talks about the pollution. uh, thank God for City Con and his mayoral staff who are trying to do something about it. I actually read today, I think, that London is actually having its first zero emissions street, which means that it's not pedestrianized, which is what I immediately thought. um, it's a street for cars, but they have to be electric vehicles or vehicles that don't have any emissions. So basically, as you're driving up to the street, there's all these signs being like, don't come down here if you're a polluter. I'm not really sure what happens if you drive down and you don't have an electric vehicle, whether they're like, they'll be fines or what. But anyway, I think that's cool. But the pollutions gross. um, what don't I like about London commuting the tube. Speaking of pollution, what's going on with the tube? I mean, we live it's like the 21st century, and it's like the most polluted thing ever for our first world. I guess I guess that's a privileged thing to say.
