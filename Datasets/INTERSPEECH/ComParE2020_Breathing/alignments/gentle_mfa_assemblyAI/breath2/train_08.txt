I've lived in London since I was born <breath> um I've lived here my whole life and <breath> um um so I'm <breath> a little bit sort of blase about it I guess <breath> um I don't <breath> see as many benefits as some people do but I do still like the city <breath> um <breath> some things that I like most about London um is the people <breath> So I think <breath> the rest range of people in London is um really unique <breath> And I love um getting to know people from different places and with different experiences and things <breath> um <breath> something else I like about London a lot is that <breath> um <breath> there's always something going on <breath> so you can always find something to do <breath> if you want to <breath> um <breath> and there's kind of unique stuff that doesn't happen so much in other places like <breath> there's always some new kind of shop opening or <breath> a new kind of event happening or something like that <breath> um <breath> but there's <breath> a few things I don't like about London so I think my least favorite thing is that there's not <breath> much green space So <breath> <breath> I definitely like to be <breath> uh in <breath> London <breath> but just with more greenery and more nature <breath> um <breath> that's my least favorite thing But I also don't like how it's um <breath> so busy that sometimes people don't take the time to talk to each other or even notice each other <breath> <breath> <breath> and um <breath> they just sort of go about their business every day <breath> um <breath> so <breath> I would say <breath> that um overall I really like London but it definitely has its ups and downs um <breath> and if I <breath> move out of London I'd like to go somewhere with a sort of more of a small community feel <breath> and definitely more access to <breath> nature like mountains or forests or lakes or stuff like that <breath> um <breath> so my favorite cuisine is <breath> um like Japanese food There's quite a lot of it available in London <breath> um <breath> but I <breath> have <breath> a favorite restaurant as well <breath> um <breath> it's probably Tokyo dinah which is near Leicester Square <breath> um and it does really really nice vegetarian Japanese food <breath> um <breath> so I've and vegetarian as well and it's sometimes quite difficult to find Japanese food without fish <breath> um <breath> or pork So <breath> yeah I really appreciate that um <breath> they do really good like food with <breath> um tofu or with <breath> other sort of vegetarian substitutes um that don't have meat or fish <breath> um and my favorite food that they do there is the Tofu katsu curry <breath> um <breath> I've been to <breath> a lot of parks in London but I definitely want to explore them more My um <breath> <breath> favorite is probably Hampshire heath just because it's so big and there are so many dogs there I really like dogs <breath> um <breath> so <breath> yeah my favorite is probably hampstead heath but I haven't actually been to Richmond Park which is <breath> kind of crazy because I've lived here all my life But <breath> yeah uh I kind of always feel like I will do it one day but just never sort of get round to it because I just <breath> I know it's sort of not going to go anywhere <breath> um <breath> so I definitely want to do that <breath> um <breath> St james's park is also really nice I like the water there and the birds and stuff like that <breath> That's um <breath> something I really like about London as well Even though it's um an urban environment there's a lot of birds <breath> and in the morning you can hear bird song and things which is very nice <breath> um <breath> if I met someone that was new to the city I would definitely recommend they go to the heath In fact whenever someone's visiting I always recommend they go there because <breath> um <breath> quite a few people visit London but don't know about the heath <breath> um hansen heath So <breath> I think it's really nice and there's so much of it to explore and get to know <breath> And um <breath> it's kind of a way you can <breath> feel like you're away from the busyness of the city <breath> um while being <breath> still very much within the city <breath> um <breath> so yeah I recommend
