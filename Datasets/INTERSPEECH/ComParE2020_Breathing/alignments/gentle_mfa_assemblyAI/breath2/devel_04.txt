Um so I moved to London for the first time in 2014 uh for my Masters degree <breath> I studied social policy and development at Dallasy <breath> um I was in London for a year but then afterwards moved to frankfurt with my partner um because he got a job there he's German <breath> We stayed in frankfurt for a year but then decided that it was a bit dull for us so we decided to move back to London <breath> um in 2016 and I've been in London since then um <breath> we quite like London It's an exciting city um <breath> we like how cosmopolitan it is how you can <breath> find things to do um at any time of day in any area um <breath> we like the range of cultures food ah cinema <breath> theater all of that um I think it's a really great city and <breath> have met a lot of interesting people from around the world <breath> However sometimes I find London a bit stressful um it feels a bit isolating and dirty Rent um <breath> is extremely high given how low the salaries are um <breath> but I still think <breath> it's a fun city to be in while you're young <breath> um particularly what I like about London is <breath> <breath> the diverse uh culture around cuisines that it has <breath> um the other day I went to an ethiopian restaurant which I quite liked um I haven't had ethiopian food elsewhere before <breath> um <breath> and <breath> in particular the cuisine that I think I like most is um Indian One of my favorite restaurants is dishum <breath> I um go there regularly with my partner and <breath> a friend of ours We meet there maybe once or twice a month for breakfast on the weekends And it's <breath> really nice because it's become part of our <breath> routine uh and <breath> a place to meet up with friends and um enjoy a nice meal <breath> <breath> um <breath> my favorite parks in London I would say are Victoria Park um <breath> and hackney Downs So I live in hackney and Stoke newington <breath> actually Cliffhold Park as well um and I think that's an important part <breath> of <breath> what we do and how we get away from the busy life of the city um <breath> I enjoy going to the parks and <breath> um <breath> just watching people play basketball or football lying down reading um taking a jog taking a nap <breath> um Victoria Park I quite like in the summer It's really full and bustling and <breath> really big so you can just <breath> meander about for a long time um hackney Downs is more <breath> local um so it feels like it's really part of the community <breath> crystalled park is really lovely as well It's very family oriented so <breath> you can find deer and birds and <breath> goats I guess and horses or whatever <breath> um which is also nice because it it also gives kind of a community feel um <breath> <breath> <breath> <breath> I haven't really done touristy stuff in London for quite a long time When um my partner and I moved back to London in <breath> 2016 we had a bunch of friends coming almost every weekend so <breath> we would take them to a lot of the tourist attractions <breath> london Eye South Bank tate Borough Market <breath> a lot of stuff around this side of the city this side of the river as well St um paul's <breath> shortage Brick lane <breath> We um almost had kind of a routine and we just walk around with our friends <breath> chat but also kind of lazily look around which is <breath> another nice thing about London is <breath> you can just ample about but your eye can still be interested in what you see architecturally um kind of the <breath> uh people the graffiti all of that I think it's really it's um really nice <breath> to walk around some um <breath> of the stuff I would say is a bit <breath> overrated but I guess that's because I've done it so many times that <breath> it's no longer novel to me
