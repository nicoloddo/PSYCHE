So I'm in London because I live in London And I work in London <breath> um I live in North London uh up in hornsey <breath> It's uh kind of between turnpike Lane and mozilla Hill <breath> And I work at ucl which is in bloom Spray in the center of London <breath> I've lived here for about <breath> 15 years <breath> um the things I really like about London I really like that London is huge and <breath> I like that it's busy And I like that it's full of all the different types of people you ever might encounter <breath> And I like that within that it has really nice <breath> little <breath> um <breath> towns and areas that have different character but also that they're constantly evolving and you always find something new And so <breath> I really feel like <breath> that phrase is true about when you've grown tired of London you've grown tired of life <breath> um <breath> some of the things I don't like about London <breath> i uh probably would notice that I <breath> don't <breath> like <breath> how much of a hurry everyone is in um and maybe <breath> without a bit of cold if <breath> I was <breath> spending more time in other places like <breath> I was recently in <breath> the United States and everyone was so overwhelmingly friendly <breath> And it really strikes you when you go back to London when everyone's just got their head done <breath> um <breath> but I respect that <breath> So definitely not like it I don't like the fact that it's so expensive <breath> um <breath> it gives me everything long and gives me everything but I <breath> hate that it's really expensive to buy property and things like that And that's been a bit limiting <breath> um do you have a favorite restaurant in cuisine <breath> um I'm going to tell you about where I'm going tomorrow So tomorrow I'm going to a Polish restaurant which is near where I live <breath> And I'm going to have pierogi which are these dumplings um <breath> that you can get filled with meat or filled with cheese <breath> um and I'm going to taste some vodka <breath> and I'm going to have lots of delicious little <breath> salty bits and pieces to eat um so I really like polish food <breath> I really like Turkish food of which there's loads in the area where I live so I really enjoy that <breath> <breath> um <breath> haven't been to any of the parks in London I <breath> have been to loads of parks in London <breath> I <breath> do have parks that I really like One is cliffhall Park which is in Stoke Newton I used to live near there <breath> I think it's just a really nice size There's lots of stuff going on People really use the park <breath> and it's attractive to look at <breath> And now I live right beside alexandra Park which is beside alexandra Palace And I really <breath> enjoy that It's really good for going and looking for um people out walking their dogs and looking at nice dogs So lots of people have different <breath> little yappy things and big bloodhounds and Irish wolf hounds and all sorts And I just find it really entertaining <breath> um <breath> if I met someone new what would I recommend they go and see or do <breath> I would recommend that people go to <breath> um <breath> some good craft beer breweries and there are lots around there are some around waltham stowe <breath> which are quite good There's quite a bit of variety there <breath> And I think people should go and <breath> have Turkish food on Green Lanes in North London and just <breath> stroll around and kind of soak it up I think you can't get better hospitality than in some of those restaurants <breath> um I have been deterred attractions obviously because I've lived here for so long I don't do it that often <breath> I've been on the London Eye <breath> um which I really <breath> enjoyed um other things that I've done I've sometimes gone on the <breath> kind of commuter boat up and down the thames That's quite a good thing to do with visitors <breath> um and in terms of museums I quite like the <breath> um dinosaur bit of the Natural History Museum <breath> I absolutely adore the Grant Museum which is part of ucl has um <breath> just lots of specimens of all sorts of different types of animal and it's kind of in this old Victorian style There's lots of things in jars <breath> You can sponsor specimens there <breath> and have your name kind of on top of the jar for a year I'm um which is quite cute <breath> um <breath> and <breath> other touristy things that I like to do I think walking in the South Bank is really <breath> pleasant and fun and I quite like the architecture there <breath> um but mostly I think what I like to do in London is to
