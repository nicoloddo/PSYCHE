Um I was born in London I've been <breath> in West London for all of my life I'm 27 now <breath> I was born in hillingdon Hospital in <breath> hounslow which is in West London And it is on one end of the piccadilly Line near to heathrow Airport <breath> Some of the things I like about London are ah that it's very easy to get around You <breath> um <breath> can <breath> meet lots of different people people from all around the world <breath> and <breath> try a lot of different things um particularly <breath> food music <breath> um <breath> traveling is very easy from here <breath> um what are some of the things I don't like about London It's very crowded <breath> I don't do well in crowds <breath> It can be really gloomy especially in the winter which seems to last for about nine months of the year <breath> It rains a lot <breath> um <breath> also I don't like that it's quite <breath> gray <breath> in terms of even the buildings and the pavements and everything is gray <breath> except in the summer it's fine <breath> um the one thing that is good though is that you can easily get to green spaces <breath> Apparently there are so many trees in London that <breath> it would actually officially be counted as a forest <breath> But obviously they're not all in the same place so it doesn't always feel like that <breath> Do I have a favorite restaurant M I'm <breath> <breath> <breath> <breath> not sure actually <breath> Have I been to any of the parks in London And do I have a favorite park Yes <breath> I do It's actually not one of the big ones My favorite park is Austerly Park which again is in West London where I live <breath> um <breath> you can get to that on the piccadilly Line as well if you stop at Austerally Station <breath> But it's one of their National Trust properties <breath> and it's a bit out of the way so it doesn't get a lot of people going there <breath> But it's got a big house <breath> um <breath> really big grounds It used to belong to a family who I think owned most of that area But they've um <breath> just turned the park bit of it into National Trust property <breath> It's got a lake <breath> um and a river <breath> And you can go canoeing on the river And they have like swans and ducks <breath> They also have rabbits And if you go during <breath> about the end of March beginning of April you can usually see baby ducks and baby rabbits <breath> <breath> um so it's really nice They also have cows horses chickens because <breath> they have a small working farm on the park <breath> So it's quite fun <breath> If someone was new to the city I would say <breath> <breath> probably go and see the parks because <breath> they're a good escape from the general hustle and bustle <breath> And <breath> um sometimes you need a break from that I'd say do all the touristy things because some of them are quite fun And I think especially if you live here and you've been here a long time <breath> you do miss out on doing those We also have lots of nice museums um and you can usually spend an entire day walking around one museum <breath> One particular thing that I like doing is every year they have the National <breath> Photographer <breath> the Nature Photographer of the Year and they <breath> present all the pictures in <breath> the Natural History Museum And that's always good to go and see <breath> I haven't really been to any of the <breath> tourist attractions like the London Eye We went on school trips so I've been to like madame to swords and <breath> the London dungeons and stuff like that <breath> um <breath> generally I'd say they are probably overrated I like more than nature stuff <breath> and parks and things like that and also <breath> going around museums at my own pace <breath> um <breath> other things to do in London <breath> would include <breath> I think one thing that I'm interested in doing is just going to random stations because sometimes <breath> when you're on a line so for example I take the big daily line every single day <breath> to work <breath> But I only go up to a certain point and I always wonder <breath> what is the rest of
