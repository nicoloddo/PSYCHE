What brings me to London <breath> I have lived in London since 2008 when I came down with my family from Paul which is an area of <breath> England all the way down south It's next to Bournemouth <breath> It's super sunny There's a <breath> <breath> rocky I think beach <breath> but Bournemouth was super cool <breath> um some things you like about London <breath> I like how it's <breath> got multiple cultures in one <breath> um I like the transport It takes you everywhere You don't need <breath> a car I guess <breath> I uh <breath> like that all my friends are in London <breath> What are some things you don't like about London <breath> um <breath> well I went to one of the worst schools in southeast London <breath> um so I have been chased by gangs <breath> That wasn't the most <breath> amazing time <breath> um <breath> other than that the whole crime aspect of London needs to be sorted out <breath> But yeah London's not bad at all Do <breath> you have a favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath> No not at <breath> all Though I do like this one restaurant in the two called jimmy's I believe it's called jimmy's International <breath> Just like this whole <breath> uh all you can eat buffet type place <breath> um <breath> and it's decently cheap especially for being in the O Two <breath> uh been to any have you of the parks in London <breath> No I <breath> think I've been to about two No <breath> If you met someone new to the city what would you recommend them go <breath> see <breath> To be fair despite living in London for so long I have not really been to any of the main attractions <breath> um mainly because I just had no interest as did my friends <breath> though I would recommend them to go see the museums I guess <breath> um <breath> other than that just take some sort of bus tour of the city <breath> Have you been to any tourist attractions <breath> uh the <breath> only one I've been to as of recent <breath> I think is the <breath> British Museum <breath> <breath> um <breath> I kind of enjoyed it <breath> ah it wasn't overrated <breath> there's a uh lot on display Then again there was a lot that they didn't show <breath> About three sections were cut off in the public <breath> um <breath> <breath> so <breath> just <breath> <breath> general questions then <breath> um or topic <breath> <breath> <breath> ah I am currently doing my PhD at <breath> ucl <breath> um at the icn I'm <breath> essentially trying to conduct research into asmr <breath> which is the autonomous sensory meridian response <breath> um <breath> I'm interested in asmr <breath> because it is something that <breath> has <breath> had a lack of scientific interest <breath> uh even in recent years There has only <breath> currently been four fMRI studies done on <breath> it and one physiological study focused on heart rate and skin <breath> conductance So ah doing another one would essentially <breath> kind of bolster the research base <breath> um <breath> but in my terms I would link it to <breath> uh <breath> sort of unexplored aspects of sound processing <breath> In uh particular <breath> cross modal processing within the auditory system <breath> and in particular again in the corridor auditory fields <breath> where there is sort of underexplored spatial and smat sensory aspects of it <breath> in which asmr is a prime candidate to actually <breath> try and explore that further <breath> So that is the plan <breath> um I guess interests for myself would be <breath> gaming drawing <breath> sometimes painting <breath> sort um of games I like ah open world <breath> um <breath> rpg So I can spend a lot of time <breath> and essentially escapism <breath> from other stuff essentially uni <breath> <breath> uh I like going out with my friends a lot <breath> Normally do
