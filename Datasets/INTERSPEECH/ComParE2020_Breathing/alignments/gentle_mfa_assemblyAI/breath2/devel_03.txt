Uh so I come from Singapore and I came over to London to pursue my undergraduate studies <breath> uh <breath> before <breath> uh I lived <breath> <breath> even though I'm Singapore and I've also lived in China and South Korea <breath> And before I came over to London <breath> I um studied psychology and angered science And I'm currently in my <breath> third year <breath> um so upon graduation I hope to pursue msc <breath> in <breath> Developmental psychology either at ucl or at Kings <breath> And I hope to be a uh developmental or child psychologist <breath> um <breath> so some of my hobbies include <breath> uh <breath> running as well as traveling uh I recently came back from Germany and Japan I <breath> uh have some family in Japan so I go to Japan almost <breath> every at <breath> least once a <breath> <breath> year um the favorite <breath> um country that I've been to so far <breath> I would say or rather the favorite city <breath> that I like ah thus far I think it was to be like Tokyo <breath> because I like how <breath> efficient it is I like how <breath> transport uh there is so much more convenient And I like how everything opens <breath> uh until really late at night <breath> and so I can still <breath> get food <breath> when I hang out with my friends really late <breath> um <breath> yeah uh some of the other countries that I really enjoyed visiting includes <breath> Greece <breath> mauritius <breath> um <breath> Melbourne <breath> which is part <breath> of Australia <breath> and <breath> um <breath> bali in Indonesia <breath> I think that's because I really like <breath> um <breath> the beach <breath> and I really like the sea <breath> and I really like to go south boarding <breath> So that's why <breath> I guess I really like um <breath> countries with <breath> beaches and um the seaside in general <breath> I uh hope to stay in London <breath> for another <breath> two years <breath> and <breath> potentially um <breath> move <breath> to Canada <breath> or back to South Korea where I once lived <breath> uh I want to move to Canada to Canada because I really like <breath> cold winters and I really like the snow <breath> and I just like being around nature <breath> So <breath> <breath> uh that is one of m one of the big reasons why I want to move there <breath> uh I think London might <breath> get a bit too busy for me sometimes <breath> so and there's <breath> a lot of people so that's why I might not <breath> generally uh want to live here in the long term <breath> uh South Korea is also another option for me because uh I lived there for really long and <breath> uh a lot of my friends are there <breath> <breath> uh and I think I'm also really used to the country So that's also another reason why <breath> I think I might want to move back to South Korea after <breath> living in London <breath> uh but with that said I really like London a lot I like how diverse this I like how I can meet so many different people here <breath> <breath> coming from so many different backgrounds <breath> And <breath> I like how it's also really close to Europe I think <breath> if <breath> I had not come to London to pursue my undergraduate studies I don't think I would have
