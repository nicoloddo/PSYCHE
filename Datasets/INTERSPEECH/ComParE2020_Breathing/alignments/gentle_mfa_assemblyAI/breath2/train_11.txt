What brings you to London um I moved here to <breath> start an empress program at ucl uh I was previously <breath> in New York so that was <breath> kind of a tough decision to leave the United States But I did want to get out of the United States for sure <breath> uh m But I could have stayed I guess in New York My job for one more year <breath> maybe <breath> see where that led <breath> But uh that's what brings me here So I guess exploration but also mainly school <breath> um <breath> what are some things I like about London I <breath> like the program I like the relatively calmer pace of life compared to <breath> my situation in New York for sure I like that I'm not commuting 2 hours a day on the train <breath> um <breath> <breath> I like the apartment better for sure <breath> um <breath> what are some things you do not like about I <breath> don't like that it rains every day uh a lot of days <breath> I also don't currently like the winter because it's dark out a lot <breath> I wish there was more sun and more <breath> hours in the daylight <breath> um yeah <breath> Do <breath> uh you have a favorite restaurant and cuisine So I love Mexican food I also love uh vietnamese food <breath> So they have chipotle here That's like my favorite restaurant in the States but it's a little different It's not worse or better but <breath> um it's different I've gotten it a few times but I've been trying to eat more Well I need to save money because I don't have as much <breath> so I've been eating more at home cooking meals <breath> I do feel like some of the food here is <breath> better uh quality though compared to maybe the preservatives they put in a lot of food in the States I don't know maybe that's the thing here I just noticed that <breath> um but interestingly I've had only vietnamese ah one time since I've moved here <breath> and I would get it like multiple times a week in New York <breath> um well I think it's interesting because there's a <breath> vietnamese place right across the street from me I still have not been there <breath> uh okay next question <breath> Have you been to any of the parks I just went to hyde Park <breath> this past weekend which was very very nice um <breath> I really like me and my fiance went and she loves nature and the animals <breath> um <breath> it was very nice seeing like going by the pond I really like that part <breath> and seeing all the geese and the swans is the huge swan <breath> and how they're just not really afraid of humans here It's a nice symbiotic relationship they have where <breath> they get fed can It's approach humans and take pictures and <breath> um <breath> really cool But uh as far as the park I've been to <breath> that park I've been to one other park I um <breath> can't remember the name This is just generally I need to do more exploring of the city though I feel like <breath> during the semester I focused a lot on work And now I've been off and I've had somewhat of a break and I haven't really done exploring I don't know when I will but <breath> I should be taking more advantage of that <breath> If um you met someone new to the city <breath> what would you recommend they go to see or do <breath> I probably wouldn't be the best tour guide at this point I um <breath> would just say I really like the area around piccadilly Circus uh <breath> it's probably pretty touristy but you could even just walk around there for a few hours There's <breath> a lot to see lot to do <breath> depending Whatever food you like you um <breath> can definitely find it in that area <breath> um <breath> okay I know I got to kill him but I want to go back up to what I don't like
