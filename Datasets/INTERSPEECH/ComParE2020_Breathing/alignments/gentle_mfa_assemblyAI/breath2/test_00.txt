So I came to London first in 1992 <breath> after I had finished my PhD at Oxford <breath> and I was looking for a permanent job <breath> I started first working at an institution called London guildhall University <breath> uh which later became London Metropolitan University <breath> I started first as a very junior lecturer <breath> and left London Metropolitan in 1992 <breath> as a Senior member of the Faculty of Life Sciences <breath> <breath> I started working at ucl in September 2012 <breath> and I'm currently faculty Teacher for Brain Sciences <breath> So what brought me to London initially <breath> and indeed has um maintained my stay in London <breath> has been my work which has been at two higher education institutions <breath> both really quite different <breath> and both located in different places <breath> I enjoyed working at London mets It was a trial by fire to some extent <breath> It was a post 92 university <breath> with some challenging widening participation and student achievement issues <breath> and limited resources <breath> But that made me quite creative and inventive uh <breath> in carrying out interventions to support and enhanced student experience <breath> without very much financial resources <breath> Coming to ucl has been great because It is worldclass University <breath> The caliber of students is very different <breath> and more importantly <breath> there is financial support and resources and an organization that enables you to be creative on lots of projects <breath> to enhance our uh overall student experience <breath> <breath> So I've lived in London quite a number of years now <breath> I never intended to live in London but I just went where the employment was However I have come to really really like London <breath> One of the great things I love about London are ah <breath> the people in terms of the ethnic diversity <breath> uh people live here from many different countries <breath> and have many different <breath> ethnicities <breath> and <breath> is very diverse culturally <breath> I love the parks in London <breath> I love the art galleries and the museums which are free <breath> And I love being in the capital <breath> and I miss it when I visit other places <breath> Having traveled a lot to many other countries <breath> i uh still like being British and I like being in London <breath> Some of the things that I don't like about London are the travel <breath> uh the Underground is really under resourced It's packed <breath> I live on the Northern line <breath> It's called the misery lime for a very good reason And <breath> having visited other countries such as Hong Kong and Shanghai <breath> and Beijing <breath> where they also have metro systems I can see that they have taken <breath> they've come and looked at the London Underground system and thought we're not going to do it like that <breath> So I know that it is possible to have better metro systems <breath> The other thing I don't like about London is the expense <breath> It's much more expensive to live here than it is in many other parts of the country or indeed any other part of the country <breath> <breath> I don't have a favorite restaurant um <breath> Or cuisine because one of the great things about London is the diversity of Food that you can eat here <breath> I particularly like chinese food <breath> I particularly like fish and shellfish And um there is a plethora <breath> of Places to visit and um food to Eat <breath> and I don't particularly have a favorite place <breath> <breath> I love the parks in London and my favorite park is probably clapping Common <breath> uh followed by St james's park followed by Richmond Park <breath> clapping Common is very close to where I live <breath> and I visit it frequently <breath> almost every week <breath> And it changes during the course of the seasons <breath> So at the moment
