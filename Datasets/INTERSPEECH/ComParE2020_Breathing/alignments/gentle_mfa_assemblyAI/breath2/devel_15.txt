Okay um <breath> so I'm down in London for work um and I work <breath> I do need to <breath> <breath> so I'm down in London for work um and normally I work in Newcastle and that's where I live um <breath> but ah I've got kind of like a weird situation where <breath> my fellowship up in Newcastle was meant to be hosted in London and I can only do <breath> the testing <breath> for the fellowship in London <breath> um but Newcastle paid my salary <breath> so I live there <breath> and then they just give some money to ucl for me to do some work here um which is quite nice because I'm from London originally so I get to see my family and friends and stuff <breath> um but my expenses get paid by the university which is great <breath> um some things I like about London <breath> are so I um really like the diversity of London um and I've got um <breath> um one impressively of my friends is really into um dressing <breath> really <breath> <breath> I guess um properly um <breath> like a take on <breath> modern sort of dandy um with elaborate embroidery and stuff <breath> And um he always said that <breath> um <breath> basically whenever he was in London he just never felt like he stuck out <breath> M it was only other places that he felt like people were judging him for dressing weirdly <breath> So I really like that that basically you can do whatever you want and still fit in and <breath> there's also a lot of stuff <breath> going on in London generally <breath> It's <breath> really easy to find something to do in the evenings um <breath> but I guess the thing I don't like about London <breath> uh when I was living here so I lived here for <breath> um <breath> I grew up here <breath> so I lived here until I <breath> was 18 then I spent <breath> three years in the northeast of England and I came back down here for my PhD in my Master <breath> So I spent another five years in London and now I've moved to Newcastle <breath> um <breath> and so I've spent a long time living in London <breath> um and I guess the thing is that even though I said there's always something going on <breath> when I actually lived here I never actually went out and did any of that stuff um occasionally I go out for dinner somewhere <breath> um <breath> but the kind of stuff that people do when they visit London they go to um <breath> <breath> the theater <breath> um and stuff like that and I just never got around to it because I would always really exhausted <breath> um I feel like the pace of life is generally <breath> um a lot <breath> more hectic in London <breath> um and it's a lot more stressful because it's so expensive to live in London You have to live further out from where you work <breath> which means that you spend more time commuting and you just end up generally being tired at the end of the day is what I found <breath> So you don't actually have the energy to go out and do all the cool stuff <breath> um <breath> I guess my <breath> favorite cuisine <breath> um I go through sort of <breath> different <breath> phases of liking stuff My fiance is a massive foodie <breath> um and really I just go through phases Like he goes through phases of um making different stuff And whatever he makes that's my new thing <breath> um so he got really into tacos um and actually there are some quite good taco places in <breath> London <breath> um <breath> <breath> but I mean there's good taco places all over I think <breath> um <breath> and when I lived here <breath> probably my favorite place to <breath> go in it So I lived in finbury Park and there's like a little coffee shop called blitz in Finbu Park <breath> I used to really like going there for
