I moved to London in 2017 to start my masters at ucl at the institute of cognitive neuroscience <breath> in Cognitive neuroscience <breath> So I did that for a year <breath> and then I was applying for master's degrees for a second year as part of the same program that brought me here <breath> But I decided instead to start my PhD <breath> So I started my PhD at the icn as well in 2018 and I'm doing that now <breath> I really love living in London It's completely different than where I'm used to I grew up in a very rural part of vermont in the Us So I'm <breath> very much not used to the city <breath> But I really like all the green space that London has I find that other cities I've been to like New York City <breath> and Washington DC Just don't have quite enough green for me and feel very overwhelming because of tall buildings and very corporate feel <breath> But I really like that London has lots of trees and parks and generally buildings that are not so high <breath> And I also love all of the free museums That's probably one of my favorite things about living here You don't have to spend <breath> loads of money although it's easy to do that too while going out and about in London <breath> Some things that I do not like about London are the air quality Again uh being from a very rural part of the Us I'm used to much different smelling and tasting air than in London <breath> UM I don't love that It doesn't get snow Although I guess Sometimes I do like that It's easier To commute <breath> UM in London than in vermont because you don't have to scrape off Your car full of ice and wade through sometimes like 5ft of snow to get to work <breath> or uh even just to get to your car <breath> But I don't love the cold rain that you get especially this month in January when it's like big heavy wet cold rain I don't like that <breath> UM <breath> I don't like that it gets dark really early That's something I didn't expect when I moved here <breath> I thought being from really far north in the Us Would mean that I would be used to hours of daylight being relatively short <breath> But actually I think daylight hours in <breath> January at least are about 1 hour longer in vermont <breath> than in London So I struggle sometimes with the early sunsets <breath> And my other least favorite thing about London is probably <breath> the tube although <breath> I actually really appreciate having effective public transportation So I guess that's also something I like and don't like <breath> UM my favorite restaurant in London is this place called UM <breath> no I can't remember life goddess UM it's a Greek restaurant on Store Street and it's delicious in <breath> UM <breath> general I love Greek food and Turkish food And my other favorite restaurant in London is a place called the pitted Olive which is on Lee Street not far away from the icn <breath> My favorite park in London is Richmond Park <breath> I'm not actually sure that that's yeah no it is in London <breath> UM I love that you can see all of the deer running around and it's really fun to cycle around the whole park uh although it's very challenging I learned when I went for the first time there's a massive hill right before you get to the fun part <breath> UM but I really love Richmond Park I also love hyde Park UM and regents Park <breath> And the canal at regents Park too <breath> If I met someone new to the city I would tell them to definitely check out Borough Market which is a very <breath> <breath> traditional uh thing to say but it's probably <breath> the best thing I have ever experienced in my life <breath> We get the best olive oil and cheese from Borough Market and I always tell people to go there not necessarily to buy pre made food but to buy ingredients to make food because I think they have wonderful ingredients <breath> UM <breath> I also would suggest that I always
