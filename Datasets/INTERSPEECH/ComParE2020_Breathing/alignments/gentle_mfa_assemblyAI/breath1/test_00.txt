So I came to London first in 1992 after I had finished my PhD at Oxford and I was looking for a permanent job <breath> I started first working at an institution called London guildhall University <breath> uh which later became London Metropolitan University <breath> I started first as a very junior lecturer and left London Metropolitan in 1992 <breath> as a Senior member of the Faculty of Life Sciences I started working at ucl in September 2012 and I'm currently faculty Teacher for Brain Sciences <breath> So what brought me to London initially <breath> and indeed has um maintained my stay in London has been my work which has been at two higher education institutions <breath> both really quite different and both located in different places <breath> I enjoyed working at London mets It was a trial by fire to some extent It was a post 92 university <breath> with some challenging widening participation and student achievement issues <breath> and limited resources <breath> But that made me quite creative and inventive uh in carrying out interventions to support and enhanced student experience without very much financial resources <breath> Coming to ucl has been great because It is worldclass University <breath> The caliber of students is very different and more importantly there is financial support and resources and an organization that enables you to be creative on lots of projects to enhance our uh overall student experience <breath> So I've lived in London quite a number of years now <breath> I never intended to live in London but I just went where the employment was However I have come to really really like London <breath> One of the great things I love about London are ah <breath> the people in terms of the ethnic diversity uh people live here from many different countries and have many different ethnicities <breath> and <breath> is very diverse culturally <breath> I love the parks in London I love the art galleries and the museums which are free <breath> And I love being in the capital and I miss it when I visit other places Having traveled a lot to many other countries i uh still like being British and I like being in London <breath> Some of the things that I don't like about London are the travel <breath> uh the Underground is really under resourced It's packed I live on the Northern line It's called the misery lime for a very good reason And <breath> having visited other countries such as Hong Kong and Shanghai and Beijing where they also have metro systems I can see that they have taken <breath> they've come and looked at the London Underground system and thought we're not going to do it like that So I know that it is possible to have better metro systems The other thing I don't like about London is the expense It's much more expensive to live here than it is in many other parts of the country or indeed any other part of the country <breath> <breath> I don't have a favorite restaurant um Or cuisine because one of the great things about London is the diversity of Food that you can eat here <breath> I particularly like chinese food <breath> I particularly like fish and shellfish And um there is a plethora <breath> of Places to visit and um food to Eat <breath> and I don't particularly have a favorite place <breath> <breath> I love the parks in London and my favorite park is probably clapping Common <breath> uh followed by St james's park followed by Richmond Park <breath> clapping Common is very close to where I live and I visit it frequently almost every week And it changes during the course of the seasons So at the moment
