Okay um I've always quite liked London Most of my family is here so I guess I would say perhaps family um is the main reason But I also <breath> um like the fact that it's so green and it's quite multicultural and there's just so much things to do um so many places to go So <breath> yeah I would say say that's what brings me here <breath> um <breath> in terms of things I like about London I would say <breath> I like the green spaces and I also like the fact that there are so many restaurants and there's always something to do It never really sleeps There's always something to do so <breath> you can never really get bored I think <breath> um there are so many free museums and all galleries and <breath> of that <breath> In terms of what I don't like um <breath> uh what would I say I don't like about London <breath> <breath> It's a bit too <breath> busy sometimes It can be a bit too fast paced I think So I think it needs to slow down Sometimes it's a bit too fast And also I think people don't look out for each other as much as they should People can be unkind um but I guess it's a cultural thing I perhaps do it sometimes as well um <breath> <breath> yeah I would perhaps say that uh <breath> <breath> <breath> <breath> do I have a favorite restaurant <breath> Not necessarily actually I wouldn't say I have a favorite restaurant in London <breath> um <breath> yeah <breath> perhaps I need to get out to more restaurants to be able to make a um judgment on that But I wouldn't necessarily say I do <breath> um <breath> <breath> in terms of the parks as I said that's one of my favorite things about London I quite like the green spaces and I <breath> um would say my favorite I haven't been to all the parks but <breath> um if I were to ultimately choose a favorite one it would perhaps be Hamsted heap <breath> um although Richmond Park is a close second But I really really like Hamsted heap <breath> <breath> I would say try all the museums in the galleries I think there's just so much to learn They're so fascinating and they're also free which is not very common in other countries So I would say definitely for starters try all the museum museums and galleries and um yeah that would be my recommendation <breath> <breath> <breath> um I haven't actually been to the London Eye as yet <breath> but I have been um on the River thames the boat ride and you basically get a very nice view of all the monuments and <breath> basically all the attractions in London And <breath> it was nice I wouldn't say it was overrated necessarily but um <breath> I think it was just okay um it was a nice <breath> activity to do um <breath> but I would definitely like to try the London Eye at some point um perhaps and perhaps madame tissues I've actually never been there as well <breath> um but I think that would perhaps be overrated because <breath> I m <breath> guess from my understanding it's just basically walks sculpture
