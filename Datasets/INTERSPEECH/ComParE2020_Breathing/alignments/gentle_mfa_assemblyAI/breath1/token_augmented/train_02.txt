what brings me to london <breath> i have lived in london since 2008 when i came down with my family from paul which is an area of england all the way down south it's next to bournemouth <breath> it's super sunny there's a <breath> rocky i think beach <breath> but bournemouth was super cool <breath> <disfl.um> some things you like about london <breath> i like how it's got multiple cultures in one <breath> <disfl.um> i like the transport it takes you everywhere you don't need <breath> a car i guess <breath> i <disfl.uh> <breath> like that all my friends are in london <breath> what are some things you don't like about london <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> well i went to one of the worst schools in southeast london <breath> <disfl.um> so i have been chased by gangs <breath> that wasn't the most <breath> amazing time <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> other than that the whole crime aspect of london needs to be sorted out <breath> but yeah london's not bad at all do <breath> you have a favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath> no not at <breath> all though i do like this one restaurant in the two called jimmy's i believe it's called jimmy's international <breath> just like this whole <breath> <disfl.uh> all you can eat buffet type place <breath> <disfl.um> and it's decently cheap especially for being in the o two <breath> <disfl.uh> been to any have you of the parks in london no i <breath> think i've been to about two no <breath> if you met someone new to the city what would you recommend them go see <breath> to be fair despite living in london for so long i have not really been to any of the main attractions <breath> <disfl.um> mainly because i just had no interest as did my friends <breath> though i would recommend them to go see the museums i guess <disfl.um> <breath> other than that just take some sort of bus tour of the city <breath> have you been to any tourist attractions <breath> <disfl.uh> the <breath> only one i've been to as of recent i think is the british museum <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i kind of enjoyed it <disfl.ah> it wasn't overrated <breath> there's a <disfl.uh> lot on display then again there was a lot that they didn't show about three sections were cut off in the public <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so <breath> just <breath> general questions then <disfl.um> or topic <disfl.ah> i am currently doing my phd at ucl <disfl.um> at the icn i'm <breath> essentially trying to conduct research into asmr <breath> which is the autonomous sensory meridian response <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i'm interested in asmr <breath> because it is something that has <breath> had a lack of scientific interest <breath> <disfl.uh> even in recent years there has only currently been four fmri studies done on <breath> it and one physiological study focused on heart rate and skin <breath> conductance so <disfl.ah> doing another one would essentially <breath> kind of bolster the research base <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but in my terms i would link it to <breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> sort of unexplored aspects of sound processing <breath> in <disfl.uh> particular <breath> cross modal processing within the auditory system <breath> and in particular again in the corridor auditory fields <breath> where there is sort of underexplored spatial and smat sensory aspects of it <breath> in which asmr is a prime candidate to actually <breath> try and explore that further <breath> so that is the plan <disfl.um> i guess interests for myself would be <breath> gaming drawing <breath> sometimes painting <breath> sort <disfl.um> of games i like <disfl.ah> open world <disfl.um> rpg so i can spend a lot of time <breath> and essentially escapism <breath> from other stuff essentially uni <breath> <disfl.uh> i like going out with my friends a lot normally do
