okay <disfl.um> i've always quite liked london most of my family is here so i guess i would say perhaps family <disfl.um> is the main reason but i also <breath> <disfl.um> like the fact that it's so green and it's quite multicultural and there's just so much things to do <disfl.um> so many places to go so <breath> yeah i would say say that's what brings me here <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> in terms of things i like about london i would say <breath> i like the green spaces and i also like the fact that there are so many restaurants and there's always something to do it never really sleeps there's always something to do so <breath> you can never really get bored i think <breath> <disfl.um> there are so many free museums and all galleries and <breath> of that <breath> in terms of what i don't like <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.uh> what would i say i don't like about london <breath> <breath> it's a bit too <breath> busy sometimes it can be a bit too fast paced i think so i think it needs to slow down sometimes it's a bit too fast and also i think people don't look out for each other as much as they should people can be unkind <disfl.um> but i guess it's a cultural thing i perhaps do it sometimes as well <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> yeah i would perhaps say that <disfl.uh> <breath> <breath> <breath> <breath> do i have a favorite restaurant <breath> not necessarily actually i wouldn't say i have a favorite restaurant in london <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah <breath> perhaps i need to get out to more restaurants to be able to make a <disfl.um> judgment on that but i wouldn't necessarily say i do <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> in terms of the parks as i said that's one of my favorite things about london i quite like the green spaces and i <breath> <disfl.um> would say my favorite i haven't been to all the parks but <breath> <disfl.um> if i were to ultimately choose a favorite one it would perhaps be hamsted heap <breath> <disfl.um> although richmond park is a close second but i really really like hamsted heap <breath> <breath> i would say try all the museums in the galleries i think there's just so much to learn they're so fascinating and they're also free which is not very common in other countries so i would say definitely for starters try all the museum museums and galleries and <disfl.um> yeah that would be my recommendation <breath> <breath> <breath> <disfl.um> i haven't actually been to the london eye as yet <breath> but i have been <disfl.um> on the river thames the boat ride and you basically get a very nice view of all the monuments and <breath> basically all the attractions in london and <breath> it was nice i wouldn't say it was overrated necessarily but <disfl.um> <breath> i think it was just okay <disfl.um> it was a nice <breath> activity to do <disfl.um> <breath> but i would definitely like to try the london eye at some point <disfl.um> perhaps and perhaps madame tissues i've actually never been there as well <breath> <disfl.um> but i think that would perhaps be overrated because <breath> i m <breath> guess from my understanding it's just basically walks sculpture
