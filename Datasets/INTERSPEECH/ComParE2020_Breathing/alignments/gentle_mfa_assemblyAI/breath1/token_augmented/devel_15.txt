okay <disfl.um> so i'm down in london for work <disfl.um> and i work i do need to <breath> so i'm down in london for work <disfl.um> and normally i work in newcastle and that's where i live <disfl.um> <breath> but <disfl.ah> i've got kind of like a weird situation where <breath> my fellowship up in newcastle was meant to be hosted in london and i can only do the testing for the fellowship in london <disfl.um> but newcastle paid my salary so i live there and then they just give some money to ucl for me to do some work here <disfl.um> which is quite nice because i'm from london originally so i get to see my family and friends and stuff <breath> <disfl.um> but my expenses get paid by the university which is great <breath> <disfl.um> some things i like about london <breath> are so i <disfl.um> really like the diversity of london <disfl.um> and i've got <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.um> one impressively of my friends is really into <disfl.um> dressing <breath> really <breath> <breath> i guess <disfl.um> properly <disfl.um> <breath> like a take on <breath> modern sort of dandy <disfl.um> with elaborate embroidery and stuff <breath> and <disfl.um> he always said that <disfl.um> <breath> basically whenever he was in london he just never felt like he stuck out <breath> m it was only other places that he felt like people were judging him for dressing weirdly so i really like that that basically you can do whatever you want and still fit in and <breath> there's also a lot of stuff going on in london generally it's <breath> really easy to find something to do in the evenings <disfl.um> <breath> but i guess the thing i don't like about london <breath> <disfl.uh> when i was living here so i lived here for <disfl.um> <breath> i grew up here <breath> so i lived here until i was 18 then i spent <breath> three years in the northeast of england and i came back down here for my phd in my master so i spent another five years in london and now i've moved to newcastle <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and so i've spent a long time living in london <breath> <disfl.um> and i guess the thing is that even though i said there's always something going on when i actually lived here i never actually went out and did any of that stuff <disfl.um> occasionally i go out for dinner somewhere <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but the kind of stuff that people do when they visit london they go to <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> the theater <breath> <disfl.um> and stuff like that and i just never got around to it because i would always really exhausted <breath> <disfl.um> i feel like the pace of life is generally <breath> <disfl.um> a lot <breath> more hectic in london <breath> <disfl.um> and it's a lot more stressful because it's so expensive to live in london you have to live further out from where you work which means that you spend more time commuting and you just end up generally being tired at the end of the day is what i found <breath> so you don't actually have the energy to go out and do all the cool stuff <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i guess my favorite cuisine <breath> <disfl.um> i go through sort of <breath> different <breath> phases of liking stuff my fiance is a massive foodie <breath> <disfl.um> and really i just go through phases like he goes through phases of <disfl.um> making different stuff and whatever he makes that's my new thing <breath> <disfl.um> so he got really into tacos <disfl.um> and actually there are some quite good taco places in <breath> london <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but i mean there's good taco places all over i think <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and when i lived here <breath> probably my favorite place to <breath> go in it so i lived in finbury park and there's like a little coffee shop called blitz in finbu park i used to really like going there for
