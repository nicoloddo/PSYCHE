so i moved to london just over a year ago now to start a post doc job at ucl <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i guess i applied for a few different jobs and this is the one i got i initially wasn't that sure about moving to london because <breath> whenever i'd been here before it was often <breath> seen quite big and intimidating and you know when you get the tube and then <breath> you come out of the tube and you no idea what direction you're facing or what exit you should go out of <breath> <disfl.um> and you have to start walking for google maps will even kind of catch up and tell you which direction you're going in <breath> and that was kind of my <breath> experience of london of being disoriented and lost and i don't think it really helped that i spent a lot of time in the slightly like <breath> less nice parts of london <breath> because a lot of my friends moved here after we finished undergraduate <disfl.um> and obviously <breath> no one really had any money and a lot of them were still doing further study and stuff so they kind of lived in <breath> miles away parts of london <disfl.um> like <breath> i guess berman z or <breath> <disfl.uh> shepherd's bush market and stuff and so i'd spend a lot of time <breath> traveling just to get from one place to another or you'd go out with some friends and then you'd have to get like four night buses back <disfl.um> to someone's flat where you could stay for the night <breath> or waiting for the bus <disfl.um> <breath> back to oxford where i was living at the time <breath> at sort 03 of 00 in the morning from like notting hill <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and that's kind of intimidating and so i think i always got this impression of london as kind of quite cold and unfriendly and <breath> <disfl.um> also somewhere where it's really inconvenient to get anywhere <breath> but i think actually just that at the time a lot of the people i knew lived in inconvenient places and <breath> well i guess that's obviously <breath> makes sense when you consider their students but <breath> most of london's not really like that <breath> and there are parts of london that even though they're cheaper they're also a lot nicer and easier to get around to whereas i would not say west london is particularly always like that <breath> <disfl.um> i think some of the things i like most about london are just that there's always something going on <breath> <disfl.um> there's always like a museum or an art gallery or a show that you've not seen <breath> <disfl.um> and it's kind of <breath> nice to be able to <breath> wake up one morning and not have any plans in particular of what you want to do <breath> but still be able to find something really interesting that you'll really enjoy <breath> and not have had to plan it weeks or months in advance <breath> or for it to be like <breath> the same thing that you've done and seen before <breath> <disfl.um> so that's one of the things i really like <breath> i also kind of like <breath> how i see more of my family than before because they come from near london <breath> able so they're to visit me more often <breath> <disfl.um> although it does mean that my younger sister kind of tends to turn up and is like <disfl.oh> by the way can i <breath> stay with you tonight and i'm like yeah sure but <breath> maybe some notice would have been helpful <disfl.um> <breath> yeah but i guess she's <breath> kind of at that point in her life where she's just <breath> experimenting and visiting friends and forward planning isn't <breath> as important to her <breath> <disfl.um> but it is nice even when she just <breath> turns up unexpectedly even if it's a bit stressful to find somewhere for her to sleep or <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> i don't know make sure she gets whatever train she needs in the next morning <breath> it is nice that she feels that she can just turn up and be welcome <breath> and <disfl.um> i think some of the things i don't really like about london <disfl.uh> <breath> <disfl.um> how polluted it is i mean you can't really see it <breath> and i don't think i've actually felt any effects of it but every so often you have these news <breath> bbc news articles or whatever come out that say the most polluted places in the city <breath> <disfl.um> bloomsbury is pretty bad central london is pretty bad the tube is really bad <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and whilst you can't see the effect it has on your health you kind of <breath> worry that maybe it is or maybe it will a few years down the line <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> some of my family has asthma so it's kind of always a bit of a concern
