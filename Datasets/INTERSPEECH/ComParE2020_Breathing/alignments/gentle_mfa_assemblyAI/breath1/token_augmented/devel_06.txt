what brings me to london well i'm from london so i was already here <breath> but i came to central london to start studying at ucl <breath> because i was bored of my job and thought i should do something more useful so i came to ucl to study anthropology <breath> because i'm interested in people and culture and society <breath> and so <breath> also i like london so i wanted to stay so i decided to move further into london from the south <breath> <disfl.um> and i like london because there's lots of stuff going on it's very buzzing with culture and arts and music <breath> and <breath> it's very busy which i like <disfl.um> the only thing i don't like about it is that it's difficult to go anywhere with countryside <disfl.um> i'm very outdoorsy <breath> so i like to climb rock climbing but there's not really anything outdoors so that is a problem <breath> <disfl.um> i think that in the future i probably won't stay here because i think that <breath> it's only good when you're <breath> kind of younger <disfl.um> <breath> favorite restaurant or cuisine <disfl.uh> <breath> or is it available in london well everything's available in london really cuisine wise <breath> i do quite like japanese food and <breath> there's quite a lot of that it seems quite fashionable at the moment i remember when i was younger it was kind of harder to find a japanese restaurant but <breath> there's a lot now so it's clearly very very popular <disfl.um> <breath> i like a good katsu curry <breath> nice ramen <breath> pretty nice <breath> my favorite actually i do like a <breath> lot of different <disfl.uh> asian foods <breath> but <breath> <disfl.um> yeah very tasty <breath> have <disfl.uh> i been to any of the parks in london yeah i often go to hampshire heath or go for a run i live about 20 minutes walk from there in archway <breath> so i often go for a run around there or in the summer just chill there with friends do some slack lining which is where you balance on a <breath> kind of rubber elastic thingy it's good fun <breath> also <disfl.uh> regents park is very nice <breath> but a lot busier i <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> have a friend who lives near richmond park so sometimes i go down there see the deer very nice <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i think if <breath> i met someone near the city i would probably recommend that they <breath> go to east london <breath> have a little walk around hear the <breath> local accents and that everyone from other countries knows about cockney and all that so i guess it's quite interesting <breath> <disfl.um> i have a favorite cafe in bethnal green which i would say is quite good to go to because it's very <breath> kind of classic east london <disfl.um> i'd also recommend they go to all the classic sites because it's probably more interesting to them than it is for me <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i don't really know tourist tractions very well so i'd probably be a really bad guide <breath> <disfl.uh> but yeah i'd probably show them the parks as well as i said like hampton heathen <breath> and <disfl.uh> regents park and that <breath> also the canals are really nice <disfl.um> that'd be really cool for people to see <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah i haven't really been to many of the tourist attractions i haven't been to london eye very expensive <breath> which is probably why haven't i been <breath> i went to the tower of london not long ago my mum because i thought i should really see some of these attractions <breath> and it was quite cool <breath> a lot of lot of museums in there <breath> but expensive so expensive i mean <breath> yeah you have to be a certain type of tourist to enjoy london <breath> but <disfl.um> other tourist attractions like a lot of museums obviously british museums really near ucl so i've been there quite a few times <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> there was one museum that was really good that i would recommend to people but i can't remember the name of it but it's kind of like almost like a surgery museum <breath> and there's a lot <breath> of weird body parts in like jars it's really weird and <disfl.uh> quite edgy so i think a lot of people would be interested <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but yeah overall i think yeah like a lot the of tourist attractions are probably too expensive and a little bit overrated because of that i think if it was cheaper
