i came to london for a master's degree at the royal academy of music and i was there two years <breath> <disfl.um> and i'm still there <disfl.um> as a fellow in a string quartet <breath> which sounds fancy but means very little <breath> <disfl.um> i like to go to galleries and museums that's probably my favorite thing to do in london <breath> <disfl.um> i've <breath> seen some of the exhibitions at tate five times in the past couple of months <breath> that's one of my favorite things that's available in the city and definitely one of the reasons i moved here i always wanted to move to <breath> new york or london <breath> move somewhere that was <disfl.um> a cultural mecca <breath> <disfl.um> things that i don't like about london <breath> wow these actually i think i was asked all of these questions on a date i was on a few days ago <breath> <disfl.um> it's hilarious <breath> i mean things i don't like about london there aren't really any <breath> <disfl.um> there are things that i <breath> miss from home <breath> like i miss the mountains in the ocean <breath> but <breath> that's not why we live in london and that's why i left is because <breath> vancouver people live there for the mountains in the ocean and they want to go skiing and hiking and canoeing and <breath> they don't care about going to museums or going to <breath> watch music <breath> my favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath> i mean there's so much indian food here that's a big perk pretty cool <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i missed the asian food from vancouver actually <breath> <disfl.um> over half of the metro population of vancouver is asian <breath> <disfl.um> and the chinese japanese taiwanese korean food is just incredible and i've found it hard to find affordable asian food in london but that's probably more the failure on my part than failure of the cities <breath> <disfl.um> i've been to a lot of the parks i mean currently my favorite park is waterloo park just because it's such a close walk from my house so it's <breath> easy to kind of walk over every few days and explore <breath> although i do love the heath i have a roommate that swims in the ponds every single day even though they're about four degrees right now <breath> which seems a little bit crazy to me but also i kind of want to do it but unfortunately <breath> the ponds are gendered so <breath> in the winter i feel like i need to go with someone to egg me on <breath> and i don't have anyone to egg me on alexis if you ever want to go swim in the ponds in four degree weather please <disfl.um> that would be a lot of fun <disfl.um> and potentially terrifying and awful and we might both get sick and some kind of disease like <breath> are they clean i don't know they're kind of a concerning color in the summer so not totally sure <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if you met someone new into the what would you recommend they go <disfl.um> i <breath> walk along the canals i love the canals i think that was one they of were my favorite things when i moved but i think maybe because they eased me into kind of they're like semi nature <breath> <disfl.um> but they're so beautiful and they kind of remind me of the high line which is like one of my favorite things in the world walking along the high line <breath> with a whitney right next to you walking into hell's kitchen and the canals kind of feel like that because the canals feel old and it feels like a natural center but at the same time <breath> you have this incredible new infrastructure and these modern buildings and the juxtaposition i just feel is stunning <breath> it's a beautiful way to see the city and feel a sense of calmness despite the cyclists zooming past and ringing their bells and people yelling there's still some of the chaos of london but <breath> also just a stillness and a beauty <disfl.um> <breath> the london eye <disfl.oh> man again i totally i talked about the london eye on this date i went on and i didn't like i just don't understand the whole the big deal with the london eye <breath> i've never been <breath> <disfl.um> maybe one day i'll go for a drink on the london eye and see what the view is like been to sky garden that's cool i tried to book sky garden for <breath> <disfl.um> my parents and i but it's totally booked up for the next few weeks which is sad <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but <breath> one day i'm sure i'll make it to the london eye but i don't really i don't know
