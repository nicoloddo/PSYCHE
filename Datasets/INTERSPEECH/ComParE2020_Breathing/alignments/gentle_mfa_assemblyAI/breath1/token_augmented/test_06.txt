i took a walk in st james's park <breath> i think that's a poem somehow which is rather rude which i'm not going to recite here <breath> but it's a <disfl.ah> restoration poem by the rochford i think <breath> and he went something in st james's park that's the first thing jim st james's park is a very nice park i quite like going for a walk there it's got all the <breath> sights of london that you might want to see the buckingham palace and the back of downing street and horse guards parade <breath> but if you walk off st james's park and you get to green park <breath> it's <disfl.uh> equally very nice it might seem rather boring because there's no flowers there it's all green hence its name <breath> and apparently the story goes that the mistress of some king or other and i'm going to say george the fourth but i could be wrong <breath> lived across the park from <breath> st jake friday <disfl.uh> from green park think she lived somewhere near the mall not the mall what's that street called there's a street piccadilly street piccadilly something anyway near green park the station she lived there <breath> before the station was built <breath> and the old king used to cross over the park on his way to go and have his merry way with his mistress <breath> so the queen who was quite jealous of this <breath> she insisted that the park he walks through must not contain any blooms or flowers so she set a decree to make sure that he would always be remembered that the park he walks through on his way to his mistress <breath> would be devoid of color <breath> however i think it's quite a nice park so there we go <breath> now walking further along i think you get to hyde park which is ginormous even though ginormous is not an appropriate word i think <breath> but hyde park is interesting if you want to go for a long walk or a cycle i'm not a big fan of it <breath> it's very often the park where people go to see things at speaker's corner which used to be rather interesting back in the day when it was sort of very innocent <breath> and just some weird preacher but now people walk by thinking i wonder if this is going to be the next major terrorist <breath> just two minutes <breath> five minutes <disfl.oh> goodness gracious if i messed it up by stopping <breath> so if i continue along the park into hyde park and i walk past there would be terrorists or crack or weird old people in fact you don't see them these days not as much as once upon a time you might have done and when you do there's often a big police pleasant presence so it's not a very pleasant place to spend a lot of time <breath> however if you're on roller blades it's grand to go scooting around the park that way <breath> now i would say if my favorite park <breath> was in london it would probably be <breath> <disfl.um> the park next to my house it's not really a park it's more of a little graveyard <disfl.um> which might seem a bit more bid but it's very pretty <breath> and it has nice flowers in it and people often walk their dogs <breath> and i quite like a park with a lot of dogs <breath> i like dogs in fact i'm quite dog broodie i would have a dog myself if i could keep one in the flat <breath> if i walk further on to the next park nearby it's a bit crap so i don't go there very often <breath> victoria park <breath> which i used to think was the biggest but isn't <breath> is another fine park <breath> it's one along the canal side so if you want to go a cycle and <breath> go along the grand union canal and to victoria park and have an ice cream it's a grand day out <breath> in there i believe there's a little oriental garden in the middle of the pond which again is a nice little visit <breath> going south of the river we could get to <breath> <disfl.um> crystal palace area <breath> and the crystal palace park is pretty grand that's quite impressive where it used to have <disfl.um> the old crystal palace where it gets its name which was the former site of the grand exhibition <breath> or where the grand exhibition was relocated to
