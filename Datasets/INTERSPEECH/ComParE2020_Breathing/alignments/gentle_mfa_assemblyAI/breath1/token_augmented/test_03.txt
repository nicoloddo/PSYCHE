so i'm in london because i live in london and i work in london <breath> <disfl.um> i live in north london <disfl.uh> up in hornsey <breath> it's <disfl.uh> kind of between turnpike lane and mozilla hill and i work at ucl which is in bloom spray in the center of london <breath> i've lived here for about <breath> 15 years <breath> <disfl.um> the things i really like about london i really like that london is huge and <breath> i like that it's busy and i like that it's full of all the different types of people you ever might encounter <breath> and i like that within that it has really nice little <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> towns and areas that have different character but also that they're constantly evolving and you always find something new and so i really feel like <breath> that phrase is true about when you've grown tired of london you've grown tired of life <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> some of the things i don't like about london <breath> i <disfl.uh> probably would notice that i don't <breath> like <breath> how much of a hurry everyone is in <disfl.um> and maybe <breath> without a bit of cold if <breath> i was spending more time in other places like i was recently in the united states and everyone was so overwhelmingly friendly <breath> and it really strikes you when you go back to london when everyone's just got their head done <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but i respect that so definitely not like it i don't like the fact that it's so expensive <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> it gives me everything long and gives me everything but i hate that it's really expensive to buy property and things like that and that's been a bit limiting <breath> <disfl.um> do you have a favorite restaurant in cuisine <breath> <disfl.um> i'm going to tell you about where i'm going tomorrow so tomorrow i'm going to a polish restaurant which is near where i live <breath> and i'm going to have pierogi which are these dumplings <disfl.um> <breath> that you can get filled with meat or filled with cheese <breath> <disfl.um> and i'm going to taste some vodka and i'm going to have lots of delicious little salty bits and pieces to eat <disfl.um> so i really like polish food i really like turkish food of which there's loads in the area where i live so i really enjoy that <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> haven't been to any of the parks in london i have been to loads of parks in london i <breath> do have parks that i really like one is cliffhall park which is in stoke newton i used to live near there i think it's just a really nice size there's lots of stuff going on people really use the park <breath> and it's attractive to look at <breath> and now i live right beside alexandra park which is beside alexandra palace and i really <breath> enjoy that it's really good for going and looking for <disfl.um> people out walking their dogs and looking at nice dogs so lots of people have different <breath> little yappy things and big bloodhounds and irish wolf hounds and all sorts and i just find it really entertaining <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if i met someone new what would i recommend they go and see or do i would recommend that people go to <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> some good craft beer breweries and there are lots around there are some around waltham stowe <breath> which are quite good there's quite a bit of variety there <breath> and i think people should go and have turkish food on green lanes in north london and just <breath> stroll around and kind of soak it up i think you can't get better hospitality than in some of those restaurants <breath> <disfl.um> i have been deterred attractions obviously because i've lived here for so long i don't do it that often <breath> i've been on the london eye <breath> <disfl.um> which i really <breath> enjoyed <disfl.um> other things that i've done i've sometimes gone on the <breath> kind of commuter boat up and down the thames that's quite a good thing to do with visitors <breath> <disfl.um> and in terms of museums i quite like the <breath> <disfl.um> dinosaur bit of the natural history museum i absolutely adore the grant museum which is part of ucl has <disfl.um> <breath> just lots of specimens of all sorts of different types of animal and it's kind of in this old victorian style there's lots of things in jars <breath> you can sponsor specimens there and have your name kind of on top of the jar for a year i'm <disfl.um> which is quite cute <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and <breath> other touristy things that i like to do i think walking in the south bank is really <breath> pleasant and fun and i quite like the architecture there <breath> <disfl.um> but mostly i think what i like to do in london is to
