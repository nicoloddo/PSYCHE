<disfl.um> so i moved to london for the first time in 2014 <disfl.uh> for my masters degree <breath> i studied social policy and development at dallasy <breath> <disfl.um> i was in london for a year but then afterwards moved to frankfurt with my partner <disfl.um> because he got a job there he's german <breath> we stayed in frankfurt for a year but then decided that it was a bit dull for us so we decided to move back to london <breath> <disfl.um> in 2016 and i've been in london since then <disfl.um> <breath> we quite like london it's an exciting city <disfl.um> <breath> we like how cosmopolitan it is how you can find things to do <disfl.um> at any time of day in any area <disfl.um> <breath> we like the range of cultures food <disfl.ah> cinema <breath> theater all of that <disfl.um> i think it's a really great city and have met a lot of interesting people from around the world <breath> however sometimes i find london a bit stressful <disfl.um> it feels a bit isolating and dirty rent <disfl.um> <breath> is extremely high given how low the salaries are <disfl.um> <breath> but i still think it's a fun city to be in while you're young <breath> <disfl.um> particularly what i like about london is the diverse <disfl.uh> culture around cuisines that it has <breath> <disfl.um> the other day i went to an ethiopian restaurant which i quite liked <disfl.um> i haven't had ethiopian food elsewhere before <breath> <disfl.um> and in particular the cuisine that i think i like most is <disfl.um> indian one of my favorite restaurants is dishum <breath> i <disfl.um> go there regularly with my partner and a friend of ours we meet there maybe once or twice a month for breakfast on the weekends and it's really nice because it's become part of our routine <disfl.uh> and a place to meet up with friends and <disfl.um> enjoy a nice meal <breath> <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> my favorite parks in london i would say are victoria park <disfl.um> <breath> and hackney downs so i live in hackney and stoke newington <breath> actually cliffhold park as well <disfl.um> and i think that's an important part <breath> of <breath> what we do and how we get away from the busy life of the city <disfl.um> i enjoy going to the parks and <breath> <disfl.um> just watching people play basketball or football lying down reading <disfl.um> taking a jog taking a nap <breath> <disfl.um> victoria park i quite like in the summer it's really full and bustling and <breath> really big so you can just meander about for a long time <disfl.um> hackney downs is more <breath> local <disfl.um> so it feels like it's really part of the community <breath> crystalled park is really lovely as well it's very family oriented so <breath> you can find deer and birds and <breath> goats i guess and horses or whatever <breath> <disfl.um> which is also nice because it it also gives kind of a community feel <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> <breath> i haven't really done touristy stuff in london for quite a long time when <disfl.um> my partner and i moved back to london in <breath> 2016 we had a bunch of friends coming almost every weekend so <breath> we would take them to a lot of the tourist attractions <breath> london eye south bank tate borough market <breath> a lot of stuff around this side of the city this side of the river as well st <disfl.um> paul's <breath> shortage brick lane <breath> we <disfl.um> almost had kind of a routine and we just walk around with our friends <breath> chat but also kind of lazily look around which is another nice thing about london is <breath> you can just ample about but your eye can still be interested in what you see architecturally <disfl.um> kind of the <breath> <disfl.uh> people the graffiti all of that i think it's really it's <disfl.um> really nice <breath> to walk around some <disfl.um> <breath> of the stuff i would say is a bit <breath> overrated but i guess that's because i've done it so many times that it's no longer novel to me
