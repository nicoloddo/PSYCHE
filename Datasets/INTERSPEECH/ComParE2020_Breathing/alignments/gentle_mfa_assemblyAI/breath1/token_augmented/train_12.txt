<disfl.uh> so i moved to london to start a master's degree at university <disfl.uh> college london <breath> <disfl.uh> that was <breath> two years ago i think <breath> maybe a little less <breath> <disfl.um> i studied cognitive neuroscience at the icn which is <breath> by russell square <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i really enjoyed the course it was <breath> about a year it was a year <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> i didn't like being poor because i didn't have any income which wasn't great and which kind of makes living in london quite difficult <breath> but <disfl.uh> i did manage to get through the year <breath> since then i've stayed in london i actually got a job <breath> still with university college london <breath> as a research assistant which i am still doing now my contract runs out in september <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and it's been enjoyable so far i'm working with eeg <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i feel like i could probably leave it about <breath> <breath> <breath> so i like <disfl.um> <breath> there <disfl.um> <disfl.ah> lot there's of a good music in london there are some <breath> jazz bands that are active at the moment that i've <breath> seen a <breath> bunch of and i'm always learning new ones <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i don't know in the course of seeing new bands and hearing about people that are playing with certain groups that also have <breath> projects of their own <breath> <disfl.um> i've been to some <breath> jazz jams that i've really enjoyed and seen players there and gotten to know people that i really enjoy <breath> <disfl.um> there's some good ones in hackney <breath> <breath> they used to be one where i <breath> very close to where i used to live in archway <breath> <disfl.um> there's a really good <breath> night <breath> down in like portobello road which is quite a good one <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> there's probably some really good things in the south but i don't really know about it because i never go to south london <breath> <disfl.um> london <breath> <disfl.uh> what else <breath> <disfl.ah> gracious <breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> i like about london i suppose i've got a lot of friends in london <breath> <disfl.uh> because <breath> i come from the isle of wight which is hideously boring if you're over the age of about four and you've got an iq above 20 <breath> <disfl.um> so a lot of my friends from the isle of wight have either moved here or they've moved to <breath> similar cities in the south of the uk <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i've also got some friends from university that <breath> came to the uk for university and then stayed here <breath> and now live in london as well so it's quite fun <breath> going and seeing them one of them is a dj so i've gone to see him play a few times <breath> <disfl.um> another one <breath> i didn't see for a long time and he was married but then <breath> they're getting a divorce but he moved back to london for a while so i kept in touch with him for a bit and now he's been <breath> sent off to glasgow through his work so i only see him very rarely i'm going to see him very soon at new years <breath> so that'll be quite nice <disfl.um> <breath> i'll leave it on there <breath> i <breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> really don't like <breath> i suppose yeah <breath> the <breath> transport in london the fact that it takes ages to get places <breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> i kind of don't like <breath> the mentality of <breath> a lot of i think <breath> people that are native to the uk that have moved to london and kind of fallen in love with it <breath> and they don't quite realize or remember what it was like <breath> being in their hometown where <breath> they didn't hear about london all the time so you get this kind of strange mindset where people think that <breath> everything's <breath> fine and there's so much going on without realizing how <breath> bad certain parts of the uk can be or how badly they're doing compared to london <breath> and it's a really weird kind of cognitive dissonance which <breath> it's something interesting that i don't really <breath> feel like i've heard <breath> a lot of my friends talk about i always find it quite strange that <breath> they'd just kind of seem to forget everything outside of london now that they're here <breath> <disfl.uh> i <breath> <breath> guess <disfl.uh> recently i've really <breath> eaten a lot of noodles it seems <breath> and there are tons of great places
