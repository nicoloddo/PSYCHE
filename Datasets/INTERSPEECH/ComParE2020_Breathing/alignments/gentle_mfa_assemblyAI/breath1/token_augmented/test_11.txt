okay well <breath> i'd like to talk about actually <disfl.uh> my recent christmas holiday because it's quite an interesting and special and different <disfl.um> one <breath> <disfl.um> my partner and i decided this year that we were just going to take a few short days <disfl.uh> just exactly around the christmas dates <breath> to <disfl.um> go to vienna <breath> <disfl.uh> we had been on on a christmas holiday last year <disfl.uh> in germany for <breath> some of those christmas markets and we really loved it <breath> and we had read that <disfl.uh> vienna is supposed to have actually one of the best christmas markets <disfl.uh> in all of europe <breath> and <disfl.um> it was kind of around the summer that i was just <disfl.uh> looking at <disfl.um> <breath> christmas plans <disfl.uh> and yeah vienna came up and actually there was a very interesting art exhibition that came up <breath> <disfl.um> they are displaying <disfl.uh> albrecht jurors <disfl.uh> the hair which is a very famous watercolor painting that is normally not on public display <breath> <disfl.uh> they were displaying it for four months including over christmas <breath> so that kind of sealed the deal <breath> <disfl.uh> we just went ahead and booked the flights in the middle of the summer <breath> quickly <disfl.um> found accommodation <disfl.uh> we'd been to vienna once before and we knew where to stay <disfl.um> excellent hostel there <breath> <disfl.uh> and yeah we booked <disfl.uh> that room <breath> and <disfl.um> <breath> it was for the 23rd to the 26th so literally right over christmas <breath> it turns out that <disfl.uh> vienna is a fantastic city to visit over christmas <disfl.um> <breath> one of the reasons being that almost everything is actually open even on christmas day <breath> which i find it's really quite unusual in most <breath> cities even <disfl.um> <breath> the big ones like you really can't find much to do at all on christmas day but <breath> no the viennese like to keep things open <breath> <disfl.um> and so yeah we flew there on monday <disfl.uh> the 23rd immediately after checking and we went out to the christmas markets and honestly they were <breath> some of the most extraordinary christmas <disfl.um> markets i had ever seen especially <disfl.uh> <breath> the big one which is right <disfl.uh> in the <disfl.um> square <breath> where the town hall is <disfl.uh> it's pretty massive it's pretty colorful <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> it's pretty large they even have an ice rink that has apparently 3 km worth of skating <breath> not that we did the skating but <disfl.um> it was really quite interesting to see and <breath> yeah just some really great food like <disfl.uh> some really great grilled sausages we had and <disfl.uh> some paragi <breath> <disfl.uh> and it was really quite a spectacular <breath> place to be <disfl.um> <breath> however the city actually has <breath> markets throughout the city <breath> and we covered a few of the other ones a few of the smaller ones <breath> i think my favorite one was the one <disfl.uh> <breath> just <disfl.uh> outside of the big <disfl.um> cathedral there the st stephen's dome <breath> <disfl.uh> we got some really great actually that one had the best mulled wine the whole city it was one of the best mulled wines that ever <breath> tasted in my life <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and we got <disfl.uh> some really nice kind of souvenirs and gifts my <disfl.um> <breath> partner bought a nice watercolor painting of the <disfl.um> <disfl.uh> <breath> town hall christmas market that we had just been to <disfl.um> <breath> and yeah it was just a really nice feel in the city these markets were even open on christmas eve christmas day boxing day <breath> <disfl.uh> likewise the <disfl.um> exhibition that we were going to see that <disfl.uh> we went on christmas day the museum was open <breath> <disfl.uh> we also had a really lovely <disfl.um> christmas dinner at <disfl.uh> <breath> kind of a beer hall chain that you find throughout germany and austria augustiner
