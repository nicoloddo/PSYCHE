I came to London for work largely by necessity because of a lack of interesting opportunities <breath> in Ireland which is where I was born and raised <breath> I <breath> have <breath> like certain things about London certain things I don't like I like the variety I like the interesting people that I get to meet <breath> I think that there is lots of art here There are lots of lots um <breath> cultural activities that at various stages during my time in London <breath> I have participated in I have liked <breath> um I guess there are also lots of people like me here So I feel reasonably comfortable with that <breath> in a way that I don't think is possible for me <breath> back in Ireland at this stage of my life <breath> The things that I don't like in London have probably evolved in my time here <breath> And <breath> part of it is that I think London has become far more overcrowded in the last <breath> 15 20 to years that I remember it being <breath> I think that also has an effect on people's behavior I think people are a lot less <breath> well mannered <breath> in public People walking on the street seem to be quite happy to <breath> bump into people There's an expectation that <breath> everybody should get out of their way <breath> So for example I was in primrose Hill a few years ago <breath> A woman decided that she should run backwards down the hill <breath> and was quite offended that I called her on this She seemed to think that everybody else should actually get out of her way <breath> um <breath> London has become a very dirty city <breath> People just seem entitled to just chuck their <breath> litter anywhere that they go <breath> People leaving their coffee cups sitting on top of a <breath> piece of equipment in the middle of the street <breath> Equally I find that all these free bikes um for rent bikes are just parked in the middle of the pavement So for me walking along the street <breath> I'm supposed to get out of their way Why Because an American corporation wants to make money <breath> and because a lot of people think that <breath> the world revolves around them <breath> um <breath> <breath> do I have a favorite restaurant in London favorite food <breath> I've been fortunate over my career to have <breath> had years living on <breath> a business expense account where I could go and eat in very good restaurants <breath> As a result of that my preference these days is for informal places where I can chill out <breath> where I can relax <breath> and where I don't have to <breath> conform in certain ways <breath> So for me currently living around made a veil There are places like the elgin which have got <breath> good healthy food but it's not foodie food <breath> It is reasonably priced <breath> um the staff are friendly and a key part of the experience is the atmosphere <breath> <breath> The other thing I guess I like that is still Hillary here in London is sushi for me I'm a yo sushi fan <breath> The idea that I can actually walk in and get this stuff reasonably priced <breath> is very appealing <breath> Parks in London Do I have a favorite I <breath> um live quite close to regents Park for many years <breath> and I have played tennis there for about the last 15 years <breath> so I have a connection with that <breath> I'm currently walking looking after a friend's dog for the vacation <breath> as a result of which I've been taking this dog both for regents Park and to paddington Recreation Ground <breath> Yeah there's lots of good things in them um lots of space to walk around <breath> Quite enjoyable <breath> <breath> recommendations on <breath> the city for somebody coming here for the first time <breath> I think the first question is what does that person like What is interest to them <breath> The old parts of London are attractive to some people <breath> and not to others They are also
