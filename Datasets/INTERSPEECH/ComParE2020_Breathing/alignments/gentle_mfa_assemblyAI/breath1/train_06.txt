So I moved to London because my partner is studying at University of College London He is working on getting his PhD in Cognitive neuroscience <breath> And we decided that it would be fun if I moved here as well <breath> So I came from the United States <breath> and I have been living here now since <breath> the 29 January 2019 <breath> so almost full year <breath> um it's been a very exciting journey <breath> um <breath> it took me <breath> approximately eight or nine months <breath> to be able to make the move happen <breath> um <breath> I worked as a nurse back home <breath> um for almost two years <breath> And I had to <breath> go through an entire process to <breath> get my nursing license and my visa in order <breath> And now I work here <breath> um in reading as a nurse <breath> I work on a diabetes <breath> rheumatology ward <breath> which is um very different than the nursing I used to do <breath> I was previously a nurse in the intensive care unit <breath> and often worked with <breath> patients after cardiac surgeries <breath> um <breath> ear nose and throat surgeries <breath> as well as various medical conditions like respiratory failure <breath> And now I'm dealing primarily with <breath> medical patients who are generally not as sick <breath> And um <breath> my patient workload is much larger as well <breath> I was previously only working with <breath> two to three patients and now I work with an average of <breath> eight to ten patients <breath> which is quite a large difference <breath> um <breath> so it was a very large adjustment period when I first came here <breath> I had to <breath> adjust first of all just to having more patients <breath> um so there's a lot of prioritization and <breath> uh delegation that I needed to quickly learn in order to <breath> be efficient and practice safe <breath> uh nursing care <breath> um but luckily I have been working with a great team <breath> and the team that I work with are from several different countries The NHS is currently having a massive nursing shortage so <breath> they often bring in nurses from the EU <breath> as well as other countries <breath> <breath> The agency I went through is <breath> um actually based in the Philippines <breath> And so <breath> there is a large Philippine <breath> population at our hospital <breath> um as well as people from Spain Portugal <breath> um all over Africa <breath> and America surprisingly as <breath> I have yet to meet another American nurse <breath> um but that's all right <breath> ah so it's been <breath> it's been fun getting to know everyone from all these different countries <breath> and to have people with sort of a similar experience <breath> So um <breath> that definitely helped with my transition period <breath> um <breath> and now they are great friends <breath> And <breath> <breath> recently um I got to experience what the NHS <breath> is like as a patient because I had <breath> a very severe chest infection and <breath> um <breath> I had to go in an E <breath> and for um a temperature of 40 <breath> and my heart rate was over 130 <breath> and they nearly admitted me to the hospital But luckily <breath> I got a little better with some fluids and <breath> IV antibiotics <breath> um <breath> but <breath> it <breath> was very um interesting because <breath> of <breath> I had never even seen my vp <breath> yet Let alone go to ame So I was messaging <breath> all my coworkers all my friends trying to figure out what to do <breath> And they were a great support system during that time which was really nice <breath> And it was actually quite a good experience Apart from
