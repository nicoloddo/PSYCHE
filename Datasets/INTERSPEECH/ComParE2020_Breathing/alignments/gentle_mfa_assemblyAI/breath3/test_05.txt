I first came to London to start My msc and then to do my PhD because I really wanted to work with someone here at ucl <breath> Um so I moved to London but It'S not actually somewhere I ever wanted to move <breath> Um <breath> at first I found it really big um because I grew up in quite small cities <breath> um and things take things a really long time to get To places but actually as I've lived Here <breath> um I've enjoyed it a lot more um <breath> yeah I've found public transport here is really good generally <breath> um but once I started cycling in London that was Really great <breath> um because it's a lot Faster to get to different places <breath> Um and there are some really good Cycle routes to and from <breath> work for me <breath> um I find it a bit More scary to cycle on routes that I don't know because there's a lot Of traffic <breath> um but it's generally really Good <breath> um and good to get some exercise <breath> Uh I also quite like traveling on The bus rather than on the Tube <breath> Ah because it's much nicer to be Above ground than underground <breath> Um and it's also really noisy on the Tube um I don't really have a favorite Restaurant in London <breath> um but <breath> there are some really nice ones particularly ethiopian um Food which I'm going to tonight I'm looking forward to <breath> Um <breath> yeah there are lots of different styles of food <breath> um we also like to go to a fish and chip place quite near Us that has <breath> really good quality fish <breath> and also great haloumi um which is really good <breath> Um <breath> yeah I really like the area Of London that I'm in <breath> I think my favorite <breath> bit is hampstead heath and um going to places like Kenwood House <breath> because you can sort of escape London a little bit <breath> and get to somewhere a bit quieter <breath> And there are really great views of London from there that <breath> um if you Climb up the hill um especially in the evening <breath> it's really nice to climb up the hill and just look over the city when the lights go on <breath> Um really good views And actually from the top of hampstead Heath as well there's <breath> great um panoramas Of all of the city but you feel nicely removed from the city <breath> um which is really good And <breath> also at kenwood House they have really good tea and scones <breath> Um and yeah it's just a really Nice place to walk <breath> and see um lots of people with their dogs um And they have good lakes there as Well <breath> and places that you can swim in Well some people swim there all year Round <breath> uh which seems a bit mad <breath> and freezing cold I swam there once in the summer on a boiling hot day in the Middle of a very hot summer <breath> and It was so cold my hands <breath> sort Of cramped um up <breath> um so I don't know quite how They manage it in the middle of winter <breath> uh but there are people who swim in sort of the open ponds <breath> all year round Um but it does get really busy In the summer particularly when it's hot <breath> And that's a really fun thing to do in London <breath> So that's definitely the place I take visitors when they come and see me <breath> in London is actually not to the <breath> sort of classic sites like the London Eye or <breath> um anything really in the center <breath> Uh maybe because lots of my friends aren't massively keen on big cities or loads of people <breath> Um so we tend to go walking Instead <breath> uh in places that are a little bit quieter
