Uh so I moved to London in 2010 when I started university at ucl <breath> So first I studied speech and language therapy and I did the undergraduate program which uh was four years So before that I lived in working which isn't too far away from uh London anyway <breath> <breath> um but after that I moved away from London for um another two years and move back home to woking <breath> and then move back again Well um <breath> about three years ago <breath> um back to chisel So now I live in um London full time So uh some things I like about London um I love that you can <breath> kind of <breath> do anything you want anytime you want um so there's never a boring weekend There's always something more to go and see or to go and look at or that you haven't visited before Even if you're revisiting things that ah you really like <breath> I also love that it's really easy um to get around town so there's loads of ways to travel <breath> um on the overground and underground and on the buses so it's really easy to get out and about <breath> The uh other thing I love is that um they have lots of ah vegan options in London So um I became vegan in January this year <breath> and I found that there's so many options um available in and around London <breath> but these kind of reduce quite a lot when you go out of London so it's really great that all these they have um options available on uh your doorstep um some things I don't like about London I hate my commute so uh I have to commute in from West London every day um and it takes me about an hour each way <breath> and it's definitely the worst part of my day um I hate having to go home in the dark in the evening <breath> on the tube and then walk another 10 minutes in the rain <breath> I'd love to live a bit closer but I can't uh what else did I like about London um it's really busy all of the time um you can't stand still anywhere because there's always someone <breath> trying to get past you um but I also really like that aspect of London that it is busy and there's always a good atmosphere wherever you go <breath> <breath> <breath> um I don't really have a favorite restaurant in London um tend to eat in quite a few different places don't tend to go back to the same place um but like I said I'm vegan so always looking for new places to try <breath> um but I typically tend to be in East London which is kind of annoying because I live in West London so it's a little bit of a track there ah to go and visit uh a few of those places If uh I met someone new in the city I'd probably recommend um that they go and visit all the different um kind of little suburbs in London So kind of north London is obviously really different from um south and East London <breath> and they all got their own character and their all own um vibe going on So it would be <breath> kind of um amiss if you didn't go and see all of those different areas to get a real feel for the city And um I say get out of central London um get out of all the tourist traps and just go and see where people live <breath> um and go and see some of the smaller areas and have a little wander around and you'll always find something <breath> interesting to do um I haven't actually been to that many of the tourist attractions um I think I've been on the London Eye about ten years ago <breath> and um went to the London dungeons Otherwise tend to try and avoid them because they're always very busy and very expensive <breath> um <breath> <breath> london I was good Maybe a little overrated maybe a little overpriced but it is an icon and so I can see why people would want to come here and have a go on it um what else shall I talk about um have I been to any of the parks in London um yeah I used to live um on gower Street so my local park used to be Reading
