Well I'm in London because primarily that's where my work is I am working at the ucl Ear Institute which is on grey's Inn Road near Kings Cross <breath> <breath> But I've lived in London previously as well so I <breath> used to <breath> work in finance and <breath> I moved here for the first time in 2001 <breath> after finishing university <breath> I live mostly in around South London so it was initially in uh Eastullage then in clapham <breath> and then in kennington <breath> So at the moment I'm living in Oxford and I'm down in London usually three or four days a week <breath> mostly just coming down into paddington or into marybone <breath> and getting the Tube across to King's Cross <breath> um but I do have various groups of friends here who I don't see as often as I would like to <breath> um but when I do then I'll <breath> tend to go down to Central uh London or over to <breath> um <breath> Victoria where quite a few of my friends work or maybe go and stay with friends <breath> in kennington <breath> when I'm in London though <breath> um I've got fond memories of London as well from those previous times <breath> My brother used to live in East London and quite a few of his friends are still m in that area So <breath> I see them fairly often <breath> and uh quite often end up going to concerts in London <breath> sometimes with my dad who's also uh interested in music and <breath> sings And so we'll go to chamber music concerts for example <breath> Some of the things I like about London <breath> are the fact that it's got this very rich history <breath> uh and there's signs of that all over the place <breath> There are different levels of London being um built on top of one another <breath> so <breath> there are glimpses of those <breath> lower levels or those earlier levels if you look hard enough <breath> And uh I do like <breath> the cosmopolitan nature of the city <breath> the diversity of the people here <breath> the different languages you can hear spoken and the different cuisines that you can find <breath> And um <breath> the fact that there's always somewhere new to explore so there'll always be <breath> whether it's another museum or another restaurant or <breath> another neighborhood <breath> um <breath> I also like to just get on a bus and sit at the front at the top <breath> and look above the shop front level and look at the roofs of the buildings <breath> um which again can <breath> uh reveal some of London's history <breath> Things I don't like so much about London include um <breath> the <breath> rickety nature of some of the infrastructure <breath> the heat on the Underground um <breath> and although I engage in this <breath> behavior myself the fact that it is <breath> sometimes quite <breath> isolated People do their own thing You get on the Tube and <breath> there's not much eye contact <breath> I don't really notice it too much when I'm in London but when I'm away from London <breath> I'm more aware of what London misses from that perspective <breath> um other things I don't like about London <breath> I'm going to move on to the next question actually So do I have a favorite restaurant or cuisine And is it available in London <breath> I <breath> don't think I have a particular favorite <breath> I uh do enjoy Chinese food having lived in China for a while And <breath> um there's plenty of Chinese food here in London <breath> um whether you're in chinatown soho area or elsewhere <breath> I've got fond memories of a Greek cypriot restaurant in clapham North <breath> which had wonderful uh mezze and <breath> great bread that they used to make there <breath> And <breath> also um I enjoy that because it reminds me of times uh when I've been in Greece uh for example in cretor <breath> <breath> I had a good holiday in thessaloniki <breath> Have I been to any of the parks here in London Well <breath> I uh have been to several of them <breath> I don't spend as much time in the big central ones like High Park Green Park and <breath> St james's park <breath> but there are some nice open spaces elsewhere um <breath> when I was living in Delhi <breath> in fact maybe this isn't a park but
