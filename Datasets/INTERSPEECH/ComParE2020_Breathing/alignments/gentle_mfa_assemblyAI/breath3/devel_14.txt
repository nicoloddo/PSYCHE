Um what brings me to London Well I live in London so um I have lived in London for most of my life It's most probably the favourite my most favorite place in the world even though I have traveled <breath> been to other places but <breath> it's always London that uh calls you back <breath> um what are some of the things I like about London Well <breath> I like that it's so <breath> varied There's so many different things to do in London so many different types of people <breath> um <breath> uh yeah <breath> what are some of the things I don't like about London <breath> Well it rains a lot it's um quite cold <breath> um it can get quite busy <breath> There's <breath> a lot of people around <breath> um it's one of the major cities of the world so there's obviously lots of tourism <breath> that's attracted to London which is not necessarily a bad thing But um <breath> I think when you're <breath> a londoner and you're just trying to <breath> get around it can be quite difficult <breath> especially uh in the holiday seasons <breath> um <breath> do I have favorite a <breath> restaurant I have a favorite don't restaurant really <breath> um but <breath> my <breath> favorite type of cuisine <breath> is probably Turkish food or anything that's like grilled meat <breath> um so yeah it's kind of like Middle Eastern but Mediterranean style food <breath> um it's very widely available in London <breath> um particularly in certain areas of central London like eduar Road or <breath> places like that or <breath> <breath> knightsbridge um Turkish food is very tasty It's making me hungry right now even thinking about it <breath> um <breath> have I been to any parks in London Do I have a favorite park <breath> um I have been to pretty much most of the parks in London <breath> um <breath> ah don't really have a favorite one but if I had to pick I would say <breath> regents Park because it's in a really good location <breath> um having said that so is hyde Park <breath> They're uh both in really good locations depending on what <breath> other things you want to do <breath> other than just going to a park um and within the parks obviously there's <breath> sort of activities that you can do like boat riding <breath> um et cetera and stuff like that So uh it's pretty cool <breath> It's quite fun <breath> especially on a summer's day <breath> um <breath> if I met someone new to the city what would I recommend they go and see This is a good one um I think one of the things I really enjoy doing in London <breath> uh even though I might have done it more than once um is visiting the museums <breath> in South kensington <breath> And I would really recommend if somebody was new to the city <breath> um to go and visit <breath> uh like the Natural History Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum <breath> um I just think there's so much to see <breath> and so much to learn And <breath> when you're kind of a londoner from birth pretty much and you <breath> have schooled in London <breath> you've visited these museums as a child but as an adult there's just so much more value to actually going there and <breath> taking it all in <breath> um <breath> the last question have you been to any tourist attractions For example the London Eye Did you enjoy it was overheated um I've been a tourist in my own town
