Um, okay, so things that I like. Favorite restaurant. Oh, actually favorite, ah, restaurant. um, I went to sketch, ah, the other day, which had an amazing ambience and ethereal ambience, as if you're in another world, if each room has a different color and different, um, amazing, um, decor. So the orientalist section makes you feel a bit that uh, you're actually in China and then the, uh, lose the toilets are amazing because they're like space pods. So you go upstairs to a separate section if you're entering into a different, um, universe, uh, you could say with all these the toilets in the form of white pods. Also, what I liked about the restaurant, it was so tasty. Very, very, uh, incredible. um, what did, I think the best pan fried sea baths, which are smoked, that I've ever tried in my life. So the food was absolutely amazing. The service was also, um, very, um, polite, very spot on. um, it's, um, a modern British cuisine, you could say. So European fare. And anybody can go and book in the different restaurants. Okay, so some, uh, things, um, I like about London. The fact that there's a lot of things to do, there's lots of cultural pursuits. They say you could never be bored in a place like London. What you do not like about it, it's not, um, a very relaxing place to be. It's quite aggressive. um, uh, so if you want to have relaxation, it's better to live outside of London and then to come inside to London if you have to work. Favorite, ah, parks. uh, do I have a favorite park? um, I like how hyde Park during the Winter wonderland time because it has all these amazing activities to do and gives a very christmassy sort of feel. um, any tourist attraction I like, I think the Tower of London has the best tourist attraction. You could spend the whole day in there. And there's lots of, um, things to see, lots of interactives to take part in. um, and um, you get the very tasty sausage rolls and sausage, um, um, and pies over there I find as well. If someone is new, would you recommend so I recommend they go see Tariff London. I recommend if they want to go on a tour, you can go in an afternoon tea London bus that takes you around while serving you on afternoon tea. What is it called? bmb's. um, bakery, I think. um, I'd recommend you go and hang out in covent Garden to see all the energy and the vibe and all the theatrical performances and the cute independent shops that still are in covent Garden. um, I'd recommend to go to greenwich, which is like a hidden part of London. People don't go out to sea so much. You get the best advantage from, um, East greenwich meridian Line, you walk up the hill to the astronomy Museum. um, and you can have the best view, um, of London and then alter to experience maritime London. uh, where going? To the kuti sark, an old tea clipper ship. And it feels like you're in continental Europe. Not really like in London, so that's a nice place to see. um.
