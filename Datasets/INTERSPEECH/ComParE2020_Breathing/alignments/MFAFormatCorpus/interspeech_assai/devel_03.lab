Uh, so I come from Singapore and I came over to London to pursue my undergraduate studies. uh, before, uh, I lived, even though I'm Singapore and I've also lived in China and South Korea. And before I came over to London, I, um, studied psychology and angered science. And I'm currently in my third year. um, so upon graduation, I hope to pursue msc in Developmental psychology either at ucl or at Kings. And I hope to be a, uh, developmental or child psychologist. um, so some of my hobbies include, uh, running as well as traveling. uh, I recently came back from Germany and Japan. I, uh, have some family in Japan, so I go to Japan almost every at least once a year. um, the favorite, um, country that I've been to so far, I would say, or rather the favorite city that I like, ah, thus far, I think it was to be like, Tokyo, because I like how efficient it is, I like how transport, uh, there is so much more convenient. And I like how everything opens, uh, until really late at night and so I can still get food when I hang out with my friends really late. um, yeah, uh, some of the other countries that I really enjoyed visiting includes Greece, mauritius, um, Melbourne, which is part of Australia, and, um, bali in Indonesia. I think that's because I really like, um, the beach and I really like the sea and I really like to go south boarding. So that's why I guess, I really like, um, countries with beaches and, um, the seaside in general. I, uh, hope to stay in London for another two years and potentially, um, move to Canada or back to South Korea, where I once lived. uh, I want to move to Canada, to Canada because I really like cold winters and I really like the snow and I just like being around nature. So, uh, that is one of m one of the big reasons why I want to move there. uh, I think London might get a bit too busy for me sometimes, so and there's a lot of people, so that's why I might not generally, uh, want to live here in the long term. uh, South Korea is also another option for me because, uh, I lived there for really long and, uh, a lot of my friends are there. uh, and I think I'm also really used to the country. So that's also another reason why I think I might want to move back to South Korea after living in London. uh, but with that said, I really like London a lot. I like how diverse this I like how I can meet so many different people here, coming from so many different backgrounds. And I like how it's also really close to Europe. I think if I had not come to London to pursue my undergraduate studies, I don't think I would have.
