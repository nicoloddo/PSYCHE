Um, what brings me to London? Well, I live in London, so um, I have lived in London for most of my life. It's most probably the favourite, my most favorite place in the world, even though I have traveled, been to other places, but it's always London that, uh, calls you back. um, what are some of the things I like about London? Well, I like that it's so varied. There's so many different things to do in London, so many different types of people. um uh yeah, what are some of the things I don't like about London? Well, it rains a lot, it's um, quite cold, um, it can get quite busy. There's a lot of people around. um, it's one of the major cities of the world, so there's obviously lots of tourism that's attracted to London, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But um, I think when you're a londoner and you're just trying to get around, it can be quite difficult, especially uh, in the holiday seasons. um, do I have a favorite restaurant? I don't really have a favorite restaurant. um, but my favorite type of cuisine is probably Turkish food or anything that's like grilled meat. um, so yeah, it's kind of like Middle Eastern but Mediterranean style food. um, it's very widely available in London, um, particularly in certain areas of central London, like eduar Road or places like that, or knightsbridge. um Turkish food is very tasty. It's making me hungry right now, even thinking about it. um, have I been to any parks in London? Do I have a favorite park? um, I have been to pretty much most of the parks in London. um ah, don't really have a favorite one, but if I had to pick, I would say regents Park because it's in a really good location. um, having said that, so is hyde Park. They're uh, both in really good locations, depending on what other things you want to do other than just going to a park. um, and within the parks, obviously, there's sort of activities that you can do like boat riding, um, et cetera and stuff like that. So uh, it's pretty cool. It's quite fun, especially on a summer's day. um, if I met someone new to the city, what would I recommend they go and see? This is a good one. um, I think one of the things I really enjoy doing in London uh, even though I might have done it more than once, um, is visiting the museums in South kensington. And I would really recommend, if somebody was new to the city, um, to go and visit, uh, like the Natural History Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum. um, I just think there's so much to see and so much to learn. And when you're kind of a londoner from birth pretty much, and you have schooled in London, you've visited these museums as a child, but as an adult there's just so much more value to actually going there and taking it all in. um, the last question have you been to any tourist attractions? For example, the London Eye. Did you enjoy it was overheated. um I've been a tourist in my own town.
