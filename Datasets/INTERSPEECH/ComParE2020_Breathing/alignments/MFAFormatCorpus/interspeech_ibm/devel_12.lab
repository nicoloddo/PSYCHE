i moved to london in twenty seventeen to start my masters at uh ucl at the institute of cognitive neural science uh incognitive uh neural science so i did that for a year and then i was applying for master's degrees for a second year as part of the same program that brought me here but i decided instead to start my phd so i started my phd at the uh uh icn as well in twenty eighteen and i'm doing that now i really love living in london it's completely different than where i'm used to i grew up in a very rural part of vermont in the u s so i'm very much not used to the city but i really like all the green space that london has i find that other cities i've been to like new york city and washington east uh washington uh dc just don't haven't quite enough green for me and feel very overwhelming because of tall buildings and very corporate field but i really like that london has lots of trees and parks and generally buildings that are not so high and i also love all of the free museums that's probably one of the fate one of my favorite things about living here you don't have to spend loads of money although it's easy to do that to uh uh going out and about in london some things that i do not like about london are the air quality again it being from a very rural part of the u s i mean uh too much different smelling and tasting air than in london um i don't love that it doesn't get snow although i guess sometimes i do like that it's easier to commute in london and uh in vermont because you don't have to scrape off your car full of ice and wade through sometimes like five feet of snow to get to work uh uh even just to get to your car but i don't love the cold rain that you get especially this month in january when it's like big heavy wet cold rain i don't like that um i don't like that it gets dark really early that's something i didn't expect when i moved here i thought being from really far north in the us would mean that i would be used to hours of daylight being relatively short but actually i think daylight hours in the in january at least are about one hour longer in vermont than in london so i struggle sometimes with the early sunsets and my other favorite my other least favorite thing about london is probably the two but although i actually really appreciate having effective public transportation so i guess that's also something i like and don't like um my favorite restaurant in london is this place called um now i can't remember life got is um it's a greek restaurant on store street and it's delicious in um general i love greek food and turkish food and my other favorite restaurant in london is a place called the pitted all live which is on least street not far away from the icn my favorite park in london is richmond park i'm not actually sure that that's yeah i know it is in london um i love that you can see all of the deer running around and it's really fun to cycle around the whole park uh although it's very challenging i learned when i went for the first time there's a massive hill right before you get to the fun part but i really love richmond park i also love hyde park um and regions park and the canal at regions park to if i met someone new to the city i would tell them to definitely check out borrow market which is a very uh traditional thing to say but it's probably the best thing i have ever experienced in my life we get the best all oil and she is from borrow market and i always tell people to go there not necessarily to buy pre made food but to buy ingredients to make food because i think they have wonderful ingredients um i also
