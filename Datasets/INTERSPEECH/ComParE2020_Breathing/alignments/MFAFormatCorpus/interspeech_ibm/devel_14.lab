um what brings me to london well i live in london so um i have lived in london for most of uh my life it's most probably the favor my most favourite place in the world even though i have travelled been to other places but it's always london that that uh calls you back what are uh some of the things i like about london well i i like that it so uh varied there's so many different things to do in london so many different types of people um uh yeah what are uh some of the things i don't like about london well it rains a lot um it's quite cold it can um get quite busy like there's there's a lot uh of people around um it's one of the major cities of the world so there's obviously lots of tourism that's attracted to to london which is not necessarily a bad thing but um i think when you're a uh london a and you're just trying to get around it can be quite difficult uh especially in the holiday seasons um my favorite do i have a favorite uh uh i don't really have a favorite uh restaurant but uh my favorite type of cuisine is probably turkish food or anything that's like grilled meat um so yes uh uh kind of like middle eastern mediterranean style food um uh it's yeah it's very widely available in london um puts particularly in in certain uh uh areas uh of central london like eduar uh road or places like that or night spring um yeah so turkish food is is very tasty making me hungry right now even think king about it i have i've uh been to any parks in london and didn't do i have a favorite park i have been to pretty much most of the parks in london don't uh really have a favorite one but if i had to pick i would say regions park because it's in a really good location um having said that so is hide park uh the both in really good locations depending on on what other things you want to do other than just going to a park um and within the parts obviously there's other the there's sort uh um of activities that you can do like boat riding um etc stuff like that so it's uh it's pretty cool it's it's quite fun especially on a summer's day um few mets if i if i met someone new to the city what would i recommend they go and see r this is a good one um i think one of the things i really enjoy doing in london uh even though i might have done it more than once um is visiting the museums in in uh south kensington um and i would really recommend if somebody was new to the city to um uh go and visit uh like the natural history museum and victory and i'll but museum um i just think there's so much to see and so much to learn and when when you're a uh uh kind of a londonest from birth pretty much and you have schooled in london you visited these museums as a child uh uh but as an adult it's just there's just so much more value to actually uh going there and taking it all in um the question have you been to any tourist attractions for example the ones i did you enjoy it was overheated um i i
