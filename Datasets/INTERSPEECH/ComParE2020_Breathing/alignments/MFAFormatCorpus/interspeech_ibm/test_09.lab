i came to london for work largely by necessity because of a lack of interesting opportunities in ireland which is where i was born and raised i have like certain things about london certain things i don't like i like the variety i like the interesting people that i get to meet i think that there is lots of uh artier there lots of uh um cultural activities that at various stages during my time in london i have participated in i have light um i guess there are also lots of people like me here so i feel reasonably comfortable with that in a way that i don't think it's possible for me back in ireland at this stage of my life the things that i don't like in london have probably evolved in my time here and part of it as i think london has become far more overcrowded in the last fifteen to twenty years that i remember it being i think that also has an effect on peels behaviour i think people are a lot less well mannered in public your people walking in the street seem to be quite happy to bump into paper is an expectation that everybody should get out of their way so for example i was in primro's hail a few years ago a woman decided that she should run backwards down the hail and was quite offended that i called run this she seemed to think that everybody else should actually get out of her uh way um london has become a very dirty city people just seem to be seen uh um entitled to just chuck their lot their litter anywhere that they go people leaving their coffee cups sitting on top of a piece of equipment in the middle of the uh street equally i uh find that all these free bikes for these uh uh for rent bikes are just part in the mid of the pavement so for me walking on the street i'm supposed to get out of their way why because american cooperation was to make money and because of uh most people do think that the world revolves around them um do i have uh favourite restaurant in london uh favoured food i've been fortunate over my career to have its head years living on a business expense account where i could go on to eat in very good restaurants as a result that my preference these days is for informal places where i can chill out uh where i can relax and where i don't have to conform in certain ways so for me currently living around made avail there are places like the elegant which have got uh good healthy food but it's not foody food it is reasonably priced m the staff are friendly and a uh key part of the experience is the atmosphere you know the other thing i guess i like that still hillary here in london is sushi from me on a uh yosushi fan the idea that i can issue walking and get this stuff reasonably priced it's very appealing parks in london do i have a favorite uh m i live quite close to regions park for many years uh and i have played tennis therefore by the last fifteen years so i have a connection with that i'm currently walking a looking after a friend's dog for the vacation as a result of which have been taken this dog both regions park and to page in recreation ground yeah there's lots of good things in them um lots of space to walk around quite enjoyable recommendations on the city for somebody coming here for the first time i think the first question is what does that person like what is what is interested in the
