i come to london this semester uh to study abroad um i go to a small liberal art school um in maine in the u s um and was looking to have a completely different experience the semester after having uh four and a half semesters at bates i think it's awesome to go to a large university the ton of resources like what i'm doing right now um and to be in a large city um whereas louis uh bates uh is a city it's actually the second largest metropolitan area in maine um it's not saying much uh because it is made so it's awesome to be surrounded by such culture i'm in london i'm also my um that the psychology department is uh world renowned at ucl and it's the at the center theater in london uh my two uh interests um there tom things i like i love that it's a very international place um during our uh student orientation like learned that most people who uh come to london or who live in london actually came here and weren't born here and so uh there must be uh incredible diversity not just of uh races uh um ethnicities but also of backgrounds uh histories passions um experiences some things i don't like about london um it's definitely been uh a lot of rain um and i think i was expecting that though so it's not a huge downer but it was a little trickly coming here uh today actually um but sometimes it rain is nice i like when uh a rain is mixed in to uh a normal sunny week kind of mixes it up i think so far my favorite restaurant that i've gone to is probably i've been making a lot of my dinners but i've been going out to launch and i'd uh really nice sandwich at planet organic roast vegetables and humans uh sandwich because i'm a vegetarian and so it it was really really delicious um i liked it a lot so i really don't want to fall into the trap of spending ten dollars or ten pounds on a sandwich and smoothly every day uh especially because plan organic is right on campus and is so tempting to go to um i have not been to any of the major parks uh yet in london my dorm uh shape uh house um which is the ucl dorm i mean it's right by regions park and so i'm really looking forward to exploring that i love animals a lot i'm um looking forward to going to the one zoo in regions park as well um i'm in architecture class uh this term you see um and we actually have one class that's about the buildings of the the london zoo and so i'm looking forward to checking those out and so i guess that'll hopefully i'll be that that's like in week uh seven or something of the term so hopefully i'll have been to regions park already but the square right outside of this building i got here a little early so i walked around a little and it was really beautiful i think squeen square uh um uh is i've noticed in mind in their bunch of really beautiful little green spaces that kind of uh covered the city and i think that's um really special and remakes the city aesthetic if i met someone new in to the city what would you recommend them to go to see or do with my fast knowledge of london that um i've a mast in the last week i would say um go to camden market that i uh think i was my favorite day that i've had had some really good food kind of got a sense of london um walked around a lot and met some cool uh you see all people was right after the psychology uh affiliate info session and so i definitely would
