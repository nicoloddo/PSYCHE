i took a walk in since james's park i think that's a poem somewhere uh uh which is rather rude which i'm not going to recite here but it's a restoration poem by the uh uh rochford i think and he went something instant james's part that's worse than jinson james is parks a very nice park i quite got it going for a walk there that's got all the all the sites of london that you might want to see when uh the booking and palace and the back at downing street and horseguards parade but if you walk offs and james is park and you get to green park it say equally very nice it might seem rather boring because there's no flowers there it's all green hence its name and apparently this uh uh story goes that the mistress of some king or other and i'm gonna say george the fourth bar i could be wrong lived across the park from since it for death uh from green park think she lived somewhere near the uh mall not them all what's that street called as a street piccadilly street piccadilly something anyway near green park the station she lived there before the station was built and the old king used to cross over the park on his uh way to go in you know have his merry way with his mistress so the queen was quite jealous of this she insisted that the park he walks through must not contain any blooms or flowers so she set a decree to make sure that he would always be remembered that the park he walks through on his way to uh his mistress would be devoid of colour however i think it's quite a nice part so now we go now walking further along i think you get to height park which is ginormous even though ginormous is not a an appropriate word i think but hide park is it is interesting if you want to go for a long walk or a cycle i'm um not a big fan uh of it it's very often the park where people go to see things at speaker's corner which used to be rather interesting back in the day when it was sort of very uh innocent and just some weird preacher but now people want by thinking i wonder if this is going to be the next major terror wrist mister uh minutes five minutes don't goodness gracious if i messed it up by stopping so if i continue along the park into hyde park and i what uh past the would uh be terrorists or crackle wait which week uh we are do people and that you don't see them these days not as much as as once upon a time you might have done and when you do there's often a big police pleasant present so it's it's not a very pleasant place to spend a lot of time however if your own roller blades it's grant to go scooting round the park that way though uh i would say if my favourite part was in london it would probably be um the part next to my house it's not really a park it's more of um a little grave yard and which might seem a bit more bit but it's very pretty and it has nice flowers in it and people often walk their dogs and i quite like a part with a lot of dogs i like dogs that uh i'm quite dog brudy i would have a dog myself uh if i could keep one in the flat if i walk further on to the next park near by its a bit crap so i don't go there very often victoria park which i used to think was the biggest but isn't as another fine park it's one along the canal side so if you want to go a cycle and go along the grand union canal and to victoria park and have an ice cream it's a grand day out in there i believe there's a little oriental garden in the middle of the pond which again is a nice little visit going south of the river we could get to and crystal palace area and the crystal palace parks pretty grand that's quite impressive where it used to have the and the
