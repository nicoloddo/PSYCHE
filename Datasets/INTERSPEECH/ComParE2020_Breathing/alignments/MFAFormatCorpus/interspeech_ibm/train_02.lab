yeah what brings me to london i have lived in london since two thousand and eight uh when i came down my family from pool which is an area uh of england all the way down south its next to born meth it's super sunny as a rocky i think beech but born with reciprocal and uh um some things you like about london i like how it's got multiple cultures in one erm i like the transport takes you everywhere you don't uh need a car i guess ah i like that all my friends are in london what are some things you don't like about london um well i went to one of the worst schools in south east london um so i have been chased by gangs that wasn't the most amazing time um other than that uh uh the whole crime aspect of london needs to be sorted out but yeah london's not bad at all do you have a favorite restaurant or cuisine no not all uh although i do like this one restaurant in the o uh two called uh jimmies believe its court uh jimmy's international just like this whole uh or you can eat buffet tight place um and it's uh decently cheap especially for being in the o two ah a few peans any of the parts in london no uh thing i've been to about two no no no if you met someone new to the city what would you recommend them goes uh see to be fair uh you despite living in london for so long i have not really been to any of the main attractions um mainly because i just had no interest as did my friends uh although i would recommend them to go see the museums i guess uhm other than that just take some sort of bus tour of the city have you been to any tourist attractions uh the only one i've been to as a recent i think is the british museum um i kind of enjoyed it uh it was it wasn't uh overrated uh uh uh as a lot on display there then again there was a lot that they didn't show the about three sections were cut off and public uhm so just general questions then um or topic i am currently doing my got the uh um uh uh i'm essentially trying to conduct research into uh uh uh asmr which is the autonomous sensory meridian response um i'm interested in they as mar because it is something that uh has had a lack of uh scientific interest uh even of recent years there has only uh currently been four from um rice alley is done on it uh and one physiological study focused on heart rate in school connections uh so doing another one would uh uh essentially kind of bolster the research base um uhm then my terms i would link it to a sort of unexplored aspects of sound processing and in particular uh crossmodel processing within the auditory uh system and in particular again in the quarter orchestras uh uh uh uh where there is sort of onyx under explored spatial and smath century aspects of it in which a smart is a prime candidate to actually try and explore that further so that is the plan um i guess interests for myself would be gaming drawing sometimes painting um sort of games i like uh open world uh mode um uh uh rpg is
