yeah again and so i came to london to do a master's degree and and my i grew up in dublin but my dad is actually uh english so am i actually have some family in england so it's quite nice coming over to see them because we never uh never really redoctors with which is quite bad and i'm actually uh actually living with my uncle at the moment for this year and so it's quite nice to get to know them better because they're really nice and my anti has an uh unteach up so it's quite exciting or just quite interesting getting to go and there meet her friends because she's friends though these interesting artists and illustrators and and i really like in london so far this well it's really really big and it's just so much going on all the time and so many different events like that uh quite overwhelming really you can't keep it um for the more and you want to see everything and i really like uh the other day i saw at the power keeps in the park and i turned by them but i hadn't seen them and it's just really nice and expected at wacky kind of thing and it kind of fits the city i think that their wild parking seem that there shouldn't be and i don't like how big london is in a way just because it takes a base an hour uh to get to the other side or even further like anywhere you you want to go in the weekend you've to travel for ages and and i'm not used to that because it takes like two hours to cross ireland entirely so it just seems like um seems a bit ridiculous i've never spent that long and public transport and i really like all the market food stores and and all the different types of cuisine because again we didn't have that in in ireland is just like craffy mexicans with burritos or italian but the there isn't really much variety and and i found this really really nice malaysian restaurants at by eastern station last week and and it looks like fast food restaurants and looks like it's real uh uh attacky and not great food but that when you get in there is actually uh unbelievable food and it was really cheap and i haven't been to too many of the parks and i have a list on my phone of all the parks i need to go to and particularly i really want to go to home city and add try go swimming and i i don't think i'm gonna get to do it before i go home but i i had intended on trying to go for killed swim because and at christmas in dublin every year we have to jump in the sea and it's really killed so it's going to uh try prepare for that so i uh uh don't uh look like too much of a win when i'm at uh nervously edging in front of all my um friends but i'm yeah i don't think i'll get a range of that and and uh apparently there's like a slow on other results so i'd like to check that it should send quite cool and i've been through i went to winter uh wonderlands in and hide park and that was an experience uh it was definitely very christmas eve and it is really nice because it was my birthday and people from home flew over to visit me so and we went i went in there with them and uh we couldn't get him for ages because the key was really big so then by the time we did get in it was just full of really drunk adults and there is not a child in size even though the big fair ground and so that was quite fun we got a lot of mold wine and yeah very uh touristy bush good event and and if i met someone new to the city what would i recommend one thing i have uh been obsessed with is and i think i need stuff going because it's a bit getting a bit much but every uh time the tape modern has a late night uh like the last
