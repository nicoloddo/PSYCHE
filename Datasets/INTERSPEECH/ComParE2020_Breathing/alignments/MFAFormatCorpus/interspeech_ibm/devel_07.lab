the erm i don't live too far from london in general um i just live about twenty uh minutes away and um the reason why did come to london is because i studied that you co um and i studied history and philosophy of science um i've just graduated now and i'm looking for a graduate uh job in london um so i think that's basically what brings me to london um i what i like about london is arts uh it's a very fast pay city um there's lots to do there's lots of interesting people the sum call uh clubs and some cool bars i think it's quite i think it's a city with a lot of opportunities and i think i've appreciated that more when you meet people that moving to london for the first time and um you can have you know get to know their backgrounds and the lack of opportunities available in their cities so um yeah that's pretty much the things i think i like about uh in london in general um i don't like how london is very touristy sometimes it can be really frustrating especially uh arounds you know the most horrific uh areas you know under transport uh uh system for example can't uh it is not designed to handle the influx of tourists so you know uh times can be quite busy and um yeah just a bit frustrating in that uh sense it's also quite expensive city i think in terms of rents which makes it quite hard for people to go to uh move in and find a job that uh pays enough to pay rent and so on and so forth and um uh perhaps this too much happening in london this too much you know things closing down so there's lots of bars and clubs closing down recently which has been quite frustrating um and you know they've been opening up new properties as a result which has been a bit annoying um yeah i think i like indian and turkish fruits uh probably because that's uh my background um i quite like to go tenandos which is a perfectly shape but i've always gone you know as a child so it has a special place my heart um i have been to uh almost all the parks in london um i think my favorite definitely has to be hampson heath it's a little bit away from the uh touristy parts which is quite nice because it's it's usually local people that go to hampson heather uh not tourists which is nice because you know you there's lots of space and it doesn't feel too busy so you can really enjoy yourself there and have a good time relax have a picnic and you know just relax with friends in the summer it's really cool they also have some swimming pulls as well where you can go like swimming um and i think yeah it's it's quite uh nice park in general i think if there was someone new i would recommend that they would obviously have to do all the parks i think it's really cool i think perhaps yeah parks would be quite cool not uh efficient shapes i'd recommend the seventy different restaurants in london you know so i would recommend trying as many cuisines as possible and not just sticking to british food because i think particularly just quite rubbish in general um i would recommend definitely uh going to the night clubs you know we have some really famous night clubs in london you know like far break minister uh sound and egg um and i recommend you at least do one of these before you leave london because you know these clubs have been around for quite some time we have some really cool bars um oxygen's quite cool i guess you know as a tourist um perhaps going some shopping malls and checking the your galleries that would be quite cool i think i think what i quite like doing uh is going to kennefino places that not many
