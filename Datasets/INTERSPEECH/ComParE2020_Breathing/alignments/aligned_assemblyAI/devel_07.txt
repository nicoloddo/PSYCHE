Um I don't live too far from London in general um I just live about 20 minutes away And um the reason why I did come to London is because I studied at ucl um and I studied history and philosophy of science um I've just graduated now and I'm looking for a graduate job in London um so I think that's basically what brings me to London um what I like about London is that it's a very fast paced city um there's lots to do there's lots of interesting people there's some cool clubs and some cool bars um I think it's a city with a lot of opportunities and I think I've appreciated that more When you meet people that are moving to London for the first time and um you kind of get to know their backgrounds and the lack of opportunities available in their cities So um yeah that's pretty much the things I think I like about in London in general um I don't like how London is very touristy um sometimes it can be really frustrating especially around the most touristy areas um the London transport system for example is not designed to handle the influx of tourists so times can be quite busy and um yeah it's just a bit frustrating in that sense um it's also quite an expensive city I think in terms of rent which makes it quite hard for people to move in and find a job that pays enough to pay rent and so on and so forth um and perhaps there's too much happening in London There's too much things closing down so there's lots of bars and clubs closing down recently which has been quite frustrating um and they've been opening up new properties as a result which has been a bit annoying um yeah I think I like Indian and Turkish food probably because that's my background um I quite like to go to nando's which is a bit of a cliche but I've always gone as a child so it has a special place in my heart um I have been to almost all the parks in London um I think my favorite definitely has to be hampstead heath It's a little bit away from the touristy parts which is quite nice because it's usually local people that go to hamster heath are not tourists which is nice because there's lots of space and it doesn't feel too busy um so you can really enjoy yourself there and have a good time relax have a picnic and just relax with friends in the summer It's really cool They also have some swimming pools as well where you can go like swimming um and I think it's quite a nice park in general um I think if there was someone new I would recommend that they would obviously have to do all the parks I think it's really cool I think perhaps yeah parks would be quite cool um not get fish and chips I'd recommend there's so many different restaurants in London so I would recommend trying as many cuisines as possible um and not just sticking to British food because I think British food is quite rubbish in general um I would recommend definitely going to the nightclubs We have some really famous nightclubs in London like fabric and miniature sound and egg um and I recommend you at least do one of these before you leave London because these clubs have been around for quite some time We have some really cool bars um Oxford Street is quite cool I guess as a tourist um perhaps going to some shopping malls and checking the art galleries That would be quite cool I think um I think what I quite like doing is going to kind of places that not many people visit so I just like going to galleries that are not as well known um and perhaps just escaping central London So perhaps going to like zone four zone five zone six And there's some actually quite cool things to do there I think um in terms of tourists
