UM so I'm going to talk about my favorite subject which is London UM I was born in London In London Bridge UM so I'm one of the few uh real londoners UM and you'll notice this at Christmas when uh London's empty because everybody goes back to the Surrey or wherever they're from and uh they leave London to the real londoner So it's the best time to go out drinking or go to a restaurant and stuff because there's no one around UM over Christmas we normally go to a pub in Cherry Cross Road UM and it's one of the only ones that are hope open between Christmas and New Year and UM they have a great drag show there So we normally go there and then we go to the waffles shop after in uh near Old compton Street and have waffles and stuff But UM I've lived in London my whole life and it's my favorite place in the world Uh even though I'm a bit biased UM one of the things I love about it is even during this time of uh populism and right wing we're still kind of liberal and we celebrate difference and we celebrate different cultures and foods and music and people and places and stuff like that And that's one of the reasons why I'm so proud of being uh from London My family have lived in the same area for about 300 years We can trace back UM and unfortunately I'm the last person of my family to live uh in the era So UM unless I have children that would be our family name that's dead in UM that area She's quite sad but I live in the bermans era of London which was when I was a kid It was still quite uh post industrial There was empty factories and it was kind of run down There wasn't much development UM and it was kind of dark and run down but in some ways uh I missed that And it's quite interesting that we're nostalgic about the things that were quite bad for us UM it's changed quite a lot in the recent times There's new buildings and coffee shops and new people but it's hard to not feel or that it's lost its soul in some uh way And UM I think it's a double edged sword I like that there's new developments but UM I just wish that they would leave some of the stuff for the people that live around there The lawn dress and the pubs and stuff like that were the social places of the area that kind of disappearing ah now UM I've lived in lots of places all over the world but I've always kept my flat in London so that I can come home whenever I want Lived in New York for a bit which was kind of like London on the steroids but super neurotic City people shouting at each other Lived uh in Sydney for a bit Melbourne South Africa South America lived in Africa for little bits of time UM but there's no place like London UM so I'd like to stay at you still if I can when I finish my PhD because uh I don't really want to move away UM seems to be a common problem in academia is that there's fewer and fewer jobs uh as sort of the academics work well into their eighty s and stuff and for the young people coming up there's less and less jobs in research and especially UM jobs in London And academics are forced to move all over the world to get work So I'm uh not really sure what the solution is but going I'm to try my best to stay in London UM for that Uh the icm has got lots of interesting people doing UM interesting projects My own project is UM about uh what happens to your sleep structure when you lose your vision UM so there's different eye diseases affect different parts of the eye Some diseases affect the image forming layers of the ire Uh other diseases affect the retinal gangling layer which UM is the resting place for these certain class of cells which tell the brain when it's daytime or when it's nighttime UM and in certain blind paint
