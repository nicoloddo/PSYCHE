So UM my name is jamel and I've lived in London my whole life My favorite thing about London are the museums and all of the UM community centers and all the activities that you can do around there all the pubs and the clubs I guess uh my favorite area would be South kensington UM around there at Night's Bridge they have lots of of nice UM European food UM they have a taco Bell There are things that you don't really get in other places in London I guess compared to where I live UM there's nicer parks as well UM you have the bikes in London Which there isn't much in those rural Areas as well but there are starting to be built out And I guess my favorite restaurant used UM to be nando's but it's now more UM I do like a buffet that there is quite near my neighborhood So they serve lots of different types of food so they serve pizza And my favorite food would be UM Indian food to be honest Like curry So it would be the curry and The chicken lamb and the different types of rice and spices that they have Which I do know some of the names And so they have potatoes and stuff and stuff like that as well So they have pompedoms which is something Nice nothing nice which gods of the Indian being my favorite food and yeah but I guess in London there isn't really too many Indian places that I UM would go to to eat And so UM my favorite places would Be close to my home in that regard And UM I guess I went to university in London And so while I was there I was imperial in South kensington So that's another reason why south is A favorite area of mine And then we have the UM I was doing UM medicine So when I was studying medicine i UM only done basically the first year And so now I decided to work still in London But UM I was always interested in doing research I was interested in research like becoming a therapist a psychiatrist But I guess I was always thinking That uh I wasn't really into the surgical aspects of medicine And so we obviously had to do every everything we were learning the course but I wasn't really into cutting the bodies and doing some of that stuff So I thought I can find a different path And I have felt like UM it'd be easy for me to start working now and maybe go back to university later on And so I might go to improve There's lots of UM different courses that do offer similar things I guess I would still want to stay in London if I go to university UM UM I guess the idea of going to a place outside of London to like a more rural area wouldn't be too enticing for me because I guess I had most UM of my school and earlier on done in a more rural setting than UM London would be And obviously I like the fact that it's near lots of UM different places uh different types of restaurants and stuff like that And I UM guess in London the best things usually are kind of just like in the center to where they have all the different museums like in lechester Square I'd recommend UM people to go to maybe the science museums and like the art museums
