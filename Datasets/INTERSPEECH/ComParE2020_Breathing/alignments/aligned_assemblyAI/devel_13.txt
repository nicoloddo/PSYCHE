So what brings you to London um I came to London to go to university and study psychology and language sciences at ucl um but after about a term I realized this course wasn't really for me So actually I'm dropping out and I'm going to change course I'm hoping to study fine art at ucl again in September 2020 Some of the things I like about London are uh how multicultured it is and how big it is and how busy it is all the time because I came from a very small town in Wales called monmouth and it's very different from here Some of the things I do not like about London is probably the pollution and how loud it is every night because I'm not used to that and I fall asleep very lightly and I wake up very easily and the accommodation is so hot that I have to open the window every night And every night without fail I hear ambulances and police sirens and it's just very sad Favorite restaurant or cuisine um I would say my favorite cuisine is probably Asian because it's very homely to me and my family always used to cook food from Hong Kong The favorite dish made from Obergin I don't know the English translation but it tastes very very good even though it smells a bit funky Favorite um restaurant At the moment I don't really have a favorite restaurant but I did hear that Roti King near Houston Station is very good so I'll probably go visit that soon for some roti as well as for the atmosphere M I like Japanese food but a lot of the more budget end sushi is not that great here which is kind of sad But I do enjoy making sushi with my flatmates um that's quite entertaining even if we can't roll it out properly most of the time And it doesn't always taste great because most of them are vegan and we can't put a fish in it or anything Have I been to any of the parks in London Do I have a favorite park M I went to hyde Park with my course mate last term which is very fun We walked there from our accommodation which was probably about a ah 35 minutes to 40 minutes walk which is not that bad but it's quite some exercise And then we had to walk further into hyde Park to get to surf uh the serpentine I think that's the lake there It was a really chill day because it was autumn and all the leaves were starting to come down and it was quite pretty um oh I heard that uh no wait Yeah I went to Winter wonderland which I know was in hyde Park That was also very fun It was greater than I imagined and the food marketplace is very exciting and festive even though I do think that winters and Christmas is quite overrated sometimes It was nice to go there with my friends and then my family for New Years Another M thing that I noted about the park in Winter wonderland was that the rides were quite expensive which is very sad because I wanted to ride all of them but they were way too expensive and out of budget for me as a student um if you met someone new to the city what would you recommend they go see or do um I probably recommend
