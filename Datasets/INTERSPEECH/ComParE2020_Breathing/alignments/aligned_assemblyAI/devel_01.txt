Well I'm in London because primarily that's where my work is I am working at the ucl Ear Institute which is on grey's Inn Road near Kings Cross But I've lived in London previously as well so I used to work in finance and I moved here for the first time in 2001 after finishing university I live mostly in around South London so it was initially in uh Eastullage then in clapham and then in kennington So at the moment I'm living in Oxford and I'm down in London usually three or four days a week mostly just coming down into paddington or into marybone and getting the Tube across to King's Cross um but I do have various groups of friends here who I don't see as often as I would like to um but when I do then I'll tend to go down to Central uh London or over to um Victoria where quite a few of my friends work or maybe go and stay with friends in kennington when I'm in London though um I've got fond memories of London as well from those previous times My brother used to live in East London and quite a few of his friends are still m in that area So I see them fairly often and uh quite often end up going to concerts in London sometimes with my dad who's also uh interested in music and sings And so we'll go to chamber music concerts for example Some of the things I like about London are the fact that it's got this very rich history uh and there's signs of that all over the place There are different levels of London being um built on top of one another so there are glimpses of those lower levels or those earlier levels if you look hard enough And uh I do like the cosmopolitan nature of the city the diversity of the people here the different languages you can hear spoken and the different cuisines that you can find And um the fact that there's always somewhere new to explore so there'll always be whether it's another museum or another restaurant or another neighborhood um I also like to just get on a bus and sit at the front at the top and look above the shop front level and look at the roofs of the buildings um which again can uh reveal some of London's history Things I don't like so much about London include um the rickety nature of some of the infrastructure the heat on the Underground um and although I engage in this behavior myself the fact that it is sometimes quite isolated People do their own thing You get on the Tube and there's not much eye contact I don't really notice it too much when I'm in London but when I'm away from London I'm more aware of what London misses from that perspective um other things I don't like about London I'm going to move on to the next question actually So do I have a favorite restaurant or cuisine And is it available in London I don't think I have a particular favorite I uh do enjoy Chinese food having lived in China for a while And um there's plenty of Chinese food here in London um whether you're in chinatown soho area or elsewhere I've got fond memories of a Greek cypriot restaurant in clapham North which had wonderful uh mezze and great bread that they used to make there And also um I enjoy that because it reminds me of times uh when I've been in Greece uh for example in cretor I had a good holiday in thessaloniki Have I been to any of the parks here in London Well I uh have been to several of them I don't spend as much time in the big central ones like High Park Green Park and St james's park but there are some nice open spaces elsewhere um when I was living in Delhi in fact maybe this isn't a park but
