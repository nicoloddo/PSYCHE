So I'm in London because I live in London And I work in London um I live in North London uh up in hornsey It's uh kind of between turnpike Lane and mozilla Hill And I work at ucl which is in bloom Spray in the center of London I've lived here for about 15 years um the things I really like about London I really like that London is huge and I like that it's busy And I like that it's full of all the different types of people you ever might encounter And I like that within that it has really nice little um towns and areas that have different character but also that they're constantly evolving and you always find something new And so I really feel like that phrase is true about when you've grown tired of London you've grown tired of life um some of the things I don't like about London i uh probably would notice that I don't like how much of a hurry everyone is in and um maybe without a bit of cold if I was spending more time in other places like I was recently in the United States and everyone was so overwhelmingly friendly And it really strikes you when you go back to London when everyone's just got their head done um but I respect that So definitely not like it I don't like the fact that it's so expensive um it gives me everything long and gives me everything but I hate that it's really expensive to buy property and things like that And that's been a bit limiting um do you have a favorite restaurant in cuisine um I'm going to tell you about where I'm going tomorrow So tomorrow I'm going to a Polish restaurant which is near where I live And I'm going to have pierogi which are these dumplings um that you can get filled with meat or filled with cheese um and I'm going to taste some vodka and I'm going to have lots of delicious little salty bits and pieces to eat um so I really like polish food I really like Turkish food of which there's loads in the area where I live so I really enjoy that um haven't been to any of the parks in London I have been to loads of parks in London I do have parks that I really like One is cliffhall Park which is in Stoke Newton I used to live near there I think it's just a really nice size There's lots of stuff going on People really use the park and it's attractive to look at And now I live right beside alexandra Park which is beside alexandra Palace And I really enjoy that It's really good for going and looking for um people out walking their dogs and looking at nice dogs So lots of people have different little yappy things and big bloodhounds and Irish wolf hounds and all sorts And I just find it really entertaining um if I met someone new what would I recommend they go and see or do I would recommend that people go to um some good craft beer breweries and there are lots around there are some around waltham stowe which are quite good There's quite a bit of variety there And I think people should go and have Turkish food on Green Lanes in North London and just stroll around and kind of soak it up I think you can't get better hospitality than in some of those restaurants um I have been deterred attractions obviously because I've lived here for so long I don't do it that often I've been on the London Eye um which I really enjoyed um other things that I've done I've sometimes gone on the kind of commuter boat up and down the thames That's quite a good thing to do with visitors um and in terms of museums I quite like the um dinosaur bit of the Natural History Museum I absolutely adore the Grant Museum which is part of ucl has um just lots of specimens of all sorts of different types of animal and it's kind of in this old Victorian style There's lots of things in jars You can sponsor specimens there and have your name kind of on top of the jar for a year I'm um which is quite cute um and other touristy things that I like to do I think walking in the South Bank is really pleasant and fun and I quite like the architecture there um but mostly I think what I like to do in London is to
