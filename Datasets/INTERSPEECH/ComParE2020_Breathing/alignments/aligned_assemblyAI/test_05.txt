I first came to London to start My msc and then to do my PhD because I really wanted to work with someone here at ucl Um so I moved to London but It'S not actually somewhere I ever wanted to move Um at first I found it really big um because I grew up in quite small cities um and things things take a really long time to get To places but actually as I've lived Here um I've enjoyed it a lot more um yeah I've found public transport here is really good generally um but once I started cycling in London that was Really great um because it's a lot Faster to get to different places Um and there are some really good Cycle routes to and from work for me um I find it a bit More scary to cycle on routes that I don't know because there's a lot Of traffic um but it's generally really Good um and good to get some exercise Uh I also quite like traveling on The bus rather than on the Tube Ah because it's much nicer to be Above ground than underground Um and it's also really noisy on the Tube um I don't really have a favorite Restaurant in London um but there are some really nice ones particularly ethiopian um Food which I'm going to tonight I'm looking forward to Um yeah there are lots of different styles of food um we also like to go to a fish and chip place quite near Us that has really good quality fish and also great haloumi um which is really good Um yeah I really like the area Of London that I'm in I think my favorite bit is hampstead heath and um going to places like Kenwood House because you can sort of escape London a little bit and get to somewhere a bit quieter And there are really great views of London from there that um if you Climb up the hill um especially in the evening it's really nice to climb up the hill and just look over the city when the lights go on Um really good views And actually from the top of hampstead Heath as well there's great um panoramas Of all of the city but you feel nicely removed from the city um which is really good And also at kenwood House they have really good tea and scones Um and yeah it's just a really Nice place to walk and see um lots of people with their dogs um And they have good lakes there as Well and places that you can swim in Well some people swim there all year Round uh which seems a bit mad and freezing cold I swam there once in the summer on a boiling hot day in the Middle of a very hot summer and It was so cold my hands sort Of cramped um up um so I don't know quite how They manage it in the middle of winter uh but there are people who swim in sort of the open ponds all year round Um but it does get really busy In the summer particularly when it's hot And that's a really fun thing to do in London So that's definitely the place I take visitors when they come and see me in London is actually not to the sort of classic sites like the London Eye or um anything really in the center Uh maybe because lots of my friends aren't massively keen on big cities or loads of people Um so we tend to go walking Instead uh in places that are a little bit quieter
