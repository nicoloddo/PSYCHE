Um so I've come to London uh for multiple reasons Firstly I got married in September and my now husband works here uh in London so I moved here to join him here um but also I got a job um here at ucl um to work as a postdoc um which was lucky given my husband was here so that was good um london is quite different I was in Oxford before which um is a m much smaller city and I find London quite um busy and quite overwhelming um but we live quite far out um for Michael winchmore Hill which I've heard described as um just really not very like London um given it is in London it's very quiet and feels quite suburban and we have a village green and it's quite nice So um I actually like being able to escape the center and travel back out to the quiet suburbs that come in for work um and have the option to come in and um have all the attractions of London close by but um not too close um we did think about moving further in so that my commute would be better but we decided we just liked it um further out where it was a bit quieter and like to me it isn't too bad um it's 35 minutes door to door which is pretty good for London so um I feel like we kind of have the best of both worlds in that way um but there are there are lots of things I like about London too There are a lot of concerts here um which is nice We didn't have so many back in Oxford so it's cool to get to see bands I like much uh more easily um and the food as well um me and my husband quite like going to restaurants particularly he likes quite posh places so when his uh mum comes to visit we quite often go somewhere nice in London because she really likes her good food too um so yeah we've been to quite a range of different places um around where we are there's a lot of Italian restaurants not quite sure why I think there's quite a big Italian community um which is probably my favorite type of food so that's quite nice um so yeah we enjoy going out for food quite a lot um and the parks in London are cool too um we have quite a few round where we are but I like the fact that even in the center you have these quite big um open spaces that you can go to um I really like hyde Park for example that's really nice but most of them are pretty nice um so I definitely recommend those to people coming to London for the first time I think the parks are one of the best things about London um there's all sorts something I would probably recommend if someone was new to the city um would be something called the Wallace Collection which is kind of like this old house where six centric old man used to live I think maybe he was an architect or something but he collected a lot of different things a lot of random bizarre things And they're all in this house um and it's just a really interesting collection of objects and old bits of old buildings kind of all thrown in together and that was quite cool um I'm not sure many people know about that So that's probably what I would recommend to someone uh to go to if they were new to London um but I haven't really been to many of the other sort of big tourist attractions like the London I um don't know I think they're just often so busy um and full of people that I tend to steer clear um probably more I've been to tourist attractions in terms of shopping
