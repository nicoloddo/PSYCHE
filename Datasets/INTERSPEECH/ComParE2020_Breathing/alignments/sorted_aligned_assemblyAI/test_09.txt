I came to London for work largely by necessity because of a lack of interesting opportunities in Ireland which is where I was born and raised I have like certain things about London certain things I don't like I like the variety I like the interesting people that I get to meet I think that there is lots of art here There are lots lots of um cultural activities that at various stages during my time in London I have participated in I have liked um I guess there are also lots of people like me here So I feel reasonably comfortable with that in a way that I don't think is possible for me back in Ireland at this stage of my life The things that I don't like in London have probably evolved in my time here And part of it is that I think London has become far more overcrowded in the last 15 to 20 years that I remember it being I think that also has an effect on people's behavior I think people are a lot less well mannered in public People walking on the street seem to be quite happy to bump into people There's an expectation that everybody should get out of their way So for example I was in primrose Hill a few years ago A woman decided that she should run backwards down the hill and was quite offended that I called her on this She seemed to think that everybody else should actually get out of her way um London has become a very dirty city People just seem entitled to just chuck their litter anywhere that they go People leaving their coffee cups sitting on top of a piece of equipment in the middle of the street Equally I find that all these free bikes um for rent bikes are just parked in the middle of the pavement So for me walking along the street I'm supposed to get out of their way Why Because an American corporation wants to make money and because a lot of people think that the world revolves around them um do I have a favorite restaurant in London favorite food I've been fortunate over my career to have had years living on a business expense account where I could go and eat in very good restaurants As a result of that my preference these days is for informal places where I can chill out where I can relax and where I don't have to conform in certain ways So for me currently living around made a veil There are places like the elgin which have got good healthy food but it's not foodie food It is reasonably priced um the staff are friendly and a key part of the experience is the atmosphere The other thing I guess I like that is still Hillary here in London is sushi for me I'm a yo sushi fan The idea that I can actually walk in and get this stuff reasonably priced is very appealing Parks in London Do I have a favorite I um live quite close to regents Park for many years and I have played tennis there for about the last 15 years so I have a connection with that I'm currently walking looking after a friend's dog for the vacation as a result of which I've been taking this dog both for regents Park and to paddington Recreation Ground Yeah there's lots of good things in them lots um of space to walk around Quite enjoyable recommendations on the city for somebody coming here for the first time I think the first question is what does that person like What is interest to them The old parts of London are attractive to
