What brings me to London Well I'm from London so I was already here but I came to central London to start studying at ucl because I was bored of my job and thought I should do something more useful So I came to ucl to study anthropology because I'm interested in people and culture and society And so also I like London so I wanted to stay so I decided to move further into London from the south um and I like London because there's lots of stuff going on It's very buzzing with culture and arts and music and it's very busy which I like um the only thing I don't like about it is that it's difficult to go anywhere with countryside um I'm very outdoorsy so I like to climb rock climbing but there's not really anything outdoors so that is a problem um I think that in the future I probably won't stay here because I think that it's only good when you're kind of younger um favorite restaurant or cuisine uh or is it available in London Well everything's available in London really cuisine wise I do quite like Japanese food and there's quite a lot of that It seems quite fashionable at the moment I remember when I was younger it was kind of harder to find a Japanese restaurant but there's a lot now so it's clearly very very popular um I like a good katsu curry Nice ramen pretty nice My favorite actually I do like a lot of different uh Asian foods but um yeah very tasty Have uh I been to any of the parks in London Yeah I often go to Hampshire heath or go for a run I live about 20 minutes walk from there in archway so I often go for a run around there or in the summer just chill there with friends do some slack lining which is where you balance on a kind of rubber elastic thingy It's good fun Also uh regents Park is very nice but a lot busier I um have a friend who lives near Richmond Park so sometimes I go down there see the deer Very nice um I think if I met someone near the city I would probably recommend that they go to East London have a little walk around hear the local accents and that everyone from other countries knows about cockney and all that So I guess it's quite interesting um I have a favorite cafe in bethnal Green which I would say is quite good to go to because it's very kind of classic East London um I'd also recommend they go to all the classic sites because it's probably more interesting to them than it is for me um I don't really know tourist tractions very well so I'd probably be a really bad guide uh but yeah I'd probably show them the parks as well as I said like hampton heathen and uh regents Park and that Also the canals are really nice um that'd be really cool for people to see um yeah I haven't really been to many of the tourist attractions I haven't been to London eye very expensive which is probably why I haven't been I went to the Tower of London not long ago my mum because I thought I should really see some of these attractions And it was quite cool A lot of lot of museums in there But expensive So expensive I mean yeah you have to be a certain type of tourist to enjoy London But um other tourist attractions like a lot of museums obviously British museums really near ucl so I've been there quite a few times um there was one museum that was really good that I would recommend to people but I can't remember the name of it but it's kind of like almost like a surgery museum And there's a lot of weird body parts in like jars It's really weird and uh quite edgy So I think a lot of people would be interested um but yeah overall I think yeah like
