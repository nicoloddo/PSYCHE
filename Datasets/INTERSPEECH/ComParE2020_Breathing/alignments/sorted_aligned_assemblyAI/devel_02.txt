So I moved to London just over a year ago now to start a post doc job at ucl UM I guess I applied for a few different jobs and this is the one I got I initially wasn't that sure about moving to London because whenever I'd been here before it was often seen quite big and intimidating And you know when you get the Tube and then you come out of the Tube and you no idea what direction you're facing or what exit you should go out of UM and you have to start walking for Google Maps will even kind of catch up and tell you which direction you're going in And that was kind of my experience of London of being disoriented and lost And I don't think it really helped that I spent a lot of time in the slightly like less nice parts of London because a lot of my friends moved here after we finished undergraduate UM and obviously no one really had any money and a lot of them were still doing further study and stuff so they kind of lived in miles away parts of London UM like I guess berman Z or uh shepherd's Bush market and stuff And so I'd spend a lot of time traveling just to get from one place to another Or you'd go out with some friends and then you'd have to get like four night buses back UM to someone's flat where you could stay for the night or waiting for the bus UM back to Oxford where I was living at the time at sort of 03 00 in the morning from like notting Hill UM and that's kind of intimidating And so I think I always got this impression of London as kind of quite cold and unfriendly and UM also somewhere where it's really inconvenient to get anywhere But I think actually just that at the time a lot of the people I knew lived in inconvenient places and well I guess that's obviously makes sense when you consider their students but most of London's not really like that And there are parts of London that even though they're cheaper they're also a lot nicer and easier to get around to whereas I would not say West London is particularly always like that UM I think some of the things I like most about London are just that there's always something going on UM there's always like a museum or an art gallery or a show that you've not seen UM and it's kind of nice to be able to wake up one morning and not have any plans in particular of what you want to do but still be able to find something really interesting that you'll really enjoy And not have had to plan it weeks or months in advance or for it to be like the same thing that you've done and seen before UM so that's one of the things I really like I also kind of like how I see more of my family than before because they come from near London so they're able to visit me more often UM although it does mean that my younger sister kind of tends to turn up and is like oh by the way can I stay with you tonight And I'm like yeah sure but maybe some notice would have been helpful UM yeah but I guess she's kind of at that point in her life where she's just experimenting and visiting friends and forward planning isn't as important to her UM but it is nice even when she just turns up unexpectedly even if it's a bit stressful to find somewhere for her to sleep or UM I don't know make sure she gets whatever train she needs in the next morning It is nice that she feels that she can just turn up and be welcome And UM I think some of the things I don't really like about London uh UM how polluted it is I mean you can't really see it And I don't think I've actually felt any effects of it But every so often you have these news BBC News articles or whatever come out that say the most polluted places in the city UM bloomsbury is pretty bad central London is pretty bad The tube is really bad UM and whilst you can't see the effect it has on your health you kind of worry that maybe it is or maybe it will a few years down the line UM some of my family has
