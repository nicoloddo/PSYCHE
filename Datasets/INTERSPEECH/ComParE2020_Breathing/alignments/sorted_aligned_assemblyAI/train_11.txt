What brings you to London um I moved here to start an empress program at ucl uh I was previously in New York so that was kind of a tough decision to leave the United States But I did want to get out of the United States for sure uh m But I could have stayed I guess in New York My job for one more year maybe see where that led But uh that's what brings me here So I guess exploration but also mainly school um what are some things I like about London I like the program I like the relatively calmer pace of life compared to my situation in New York for sure I like that I'm not commuting 2 hours a day on the train um I like the apartment better for sure um what are some things you do not like about I don't like that it rains every day uh a lot of days I also don't currently like the winter because it's dark out a lot I wish there was more sun and more hours in the daylight um yeah Do uh you have a favorite restaurant and cuisine So I love Mexican food I also love uh vietnamese food So they have chipotle here That's like my favorite restaurant in the States but it's a little different It's not worse or better but um it's different I've gotten it a few times but I've been trying to eat more Well I need to save money because I don't have as much so I've been eating more at home cooking meals I do feel like some of the food here is better uh quality though compared to maybe the preservatives they put in a lot of food in the States I don't know maybe that's the thing here I just noticed that um but interestingly I've only had vietnamese ah one time since I've moved here and I would get it like multiple times a week in New York um well I think it's interesting because there's a vietnamese place right across the street from me I still have not been there uh okay next question Have you been to any of the parks I just went to hyde Park this past weekend which was very very nice um I really like me and my fiance went and she loves nature and the animals um it was very nice seeing like going by the pond I really like that part and seeing all the geese and the swans is the huge swan and how they're just not really afraid of humans here It's a nice symbiotic relationship they have where they can approach humans and take pictures and get fed It's um really cool But uh as far as the park I've been to that park I've been to one other park I um can't remember the name This is just generally I need to do more exploring of the city though I feel like during the semester I focused a lot on work And now I've been off and I've had somewhat of a break and I haven't really done exploring I don't know when I will but I should be taking more advantage of that If um you met someone new to the city what would you recommend they go to see or do I probably wouldn't be the best tour guide at this point I um would just say I really like the area around piccadilly Circus uh it's probably pretty touristy but you could even just walk around there for a few hours There's a lot to see lot to do depending Whatever food you like you um can definitely find it in that area um okay I know I got to kill him but
