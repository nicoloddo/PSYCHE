So I moved to London because my partner is studying at University of College London He is working on getting his PhD in Cognitive neuroscience And we decided that it would be fun if I moved here as well So I came from the United States and I have been living here now since the 29 January 2019 so almost full year um it's been a very exciting journey um it took me approximately eight or nine months to be able to make the move happen um I worked as a nurse back home um for almost two years And I had to go through an entire process to get my nursing license and my visa in order And now I work here um in reading as a nurse I work on a diabetes rheumatology ward which um is very different than the nursing I used to do I was previously a nurse in the intensive care unit and often worked with patients after cardiac surgeries um ear nose and throat surgeries as well as various medical conditions like respiratory failure And now I'm dealing primarily with medical patients who are generally not as sick And um my patient workload is much larger as well I was previously only working with two to three patients and now I work with an average of eight to ten patients which is quite a large difference um so it was a very large adjustment period when I first came here I had to adjust first of all just to having more patients um so there's a lot of prioritization and uh delegation that I needed to quickly learn in order to be efficient and practice safe uh nursing care um but luckily I have been working with a great team and the team that I work with are from several different countries The NHS is currently having a massive nursing shortage so they often bring in nurses from the EU as well as other countries The agency I went through is um actually based in the Philippines And so there is a large Philippine population at our hospital um as well as people from Spain Portugal um all over Africa and America surprisingly as I have yet to meet another American nurse um but that's all right ah so it's been it's been fun getting to know everyone from all these different countries and to have people with sort of a similar experience So um that definitely helped with my transition period um and now they are great friends And recently um I got to experience what the NHS is like as a patient because I had a very severe chest infection um and I had to go in an E and for um a temperature of 40 and my heart rate was over 130 and they nearly admitted me to the hospital But luckily I got a little better with some fluids and IV antibiotics um but it was very um interesting because I had never even seen my vp yet Let alone go to ame So I was messaging all of my coworkers all my friends trying to figure out what to do And they were a great support system during that time which was really nice And it was actually quite a
