Okay um I've always quite liked London Most of my family is here so I guess I would say perhaps family um is the main reason But I also um like the fact that it's so green and it's quite multicultural and there's just so much things to do um so many places to go So yeah I would say say that's what brings me here um in terms of things I like about London I would say I like the green spaces and I also like the fact that there are so many restaurants and there's always something to do It never really sleeps There's always something to do so you can never really get bored I think um there are so many free museums and galleries and all of that In terms of what I don't like um uh what would I say I don't like about London It's a bit too busy sometimes It can be a bit too fast paced I think So I think it needs to slow down Sometimes it's a bit too fast And also I think people don't look out for each other as much as they should People can be unkind um but I guess it's a cultural thing I perhaps do it sometimes as well um yeah I would perhaps say that uh do I have a favorite restaurant Not necessarily actually I wouldn't say I have a favorite restaurant in London um yeah perhaps I need to get out to more restaurants to be able to make a um judgment on that But I wouldn't necessarily say I do um in terms of the parks as I said that's one of my favorite things about London I quite like the green spaces and I um would say my favorite I haven't been to all the parks but um if I were to ultimately choose a favorite one it would perhaps be Hamsted heap um although Richmond Park is a close second But I really really like Hamsted heap I would say try all the museums in the galleries I think there's just so much to learn They're so fascinating and they're also free which is not very common in other countries So I would say definitely for starters try all the museum museums and galleries and um yeah that would be my recommendation um I haven't actually been to the London Eye as yet but I have been um on the River thames the boat ride and you basically get a very nice view of all the monuments and basically all the attractions in London And it was nice I wouldn't say it was overrated necessarily but um I think it was just okay um it was a nice activity to do um but I would definitely like to try the London Eye at some point um and perhaps perhaps madame tissues I've actually never been there as well um but I think that would perhaps be overrated because I m guess
