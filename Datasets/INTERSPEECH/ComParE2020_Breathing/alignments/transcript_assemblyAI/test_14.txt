M. I came to London about six years ago to study. I had finished my high school studies and I wanted to come to university. So I did two years of what they call six form here, in which I did math, physics and economics. After that I went to university in another part of London, in another part of England. And so I left London for a few years and then now I've come back to work and to finish up my studies. One of the things, the few things. That I do like about London is. The level of diversity that London brings. London is a melting pot with people from different cultures, from different countries and funny things. Everything works here in London. People get along with each other. There's a sense of community and there's a sense of understanding, even though people are probably not going to talk to you in the streets, but if you need help, there's a high chance that they will help you. And I just really love that sense of spirit and that sense of understanding. um, and some of the things I. Do not like about London is it. Is just too expensive. The city is so expensive. It feels like every time I breathe, there's money coming out of my pocket going on an account. It is not the best. um, another thing that I do not. Like about London is when traveling on. The tube during peak times or rush hour, it's just so full, people have barely time, people can barely breathe. um, but then again, it ties back to the understanding that everyone understands that this is what you have to go through to live in this wonderful city. So one of my favorite restaurants in London would have to be benihana. um, they have three locations in St. paul's, piccadilly and in Chelsea. I love benihana because it's Japanese food and I absolutely love Japanese food. The seasoning, the fresh fish, the sushi, the beef, the teriyaki sauce is just absolutely amazing. It's everything. I could eat it every day, but obviously it's too expensive, so I can't. And when it comes to parks in London, I haven't been to that many parks in London. I've been to hyde Park. And I've been to regents Park. And these are really nice parks. During the summer you can sit down and have a meal or just look at the view and just take it all in. So it's a really great experience. um, between the two, I think I would probably go for hyde Park just because you can get to harrods quite fast. I think you get to Harris from regent Park as well. um, yeah, I've never done it, but I think you should be able to because they're quite close to each other. um, so if someone you came to London and had to recommend somewhere, um, for them to go, wow. I would probably recommend the tourist attractions such as, um, buckingham palace and Big Ben, obviously, hyde Park. um, just for them to be London eye, the shard, just for them to kind of see London from a tourist perspective and to experience the culture that London has to offer. I'd also take some to, you know, some of the not so touristy parts, but parts that have such great street food, such as an area shortage hackney. Or I should have a canary wolf as well, because that's really, really nice. It's like the business district of London where all the big some of the big corporations and some of the big banks are located. And I haven't been to that many notorious attractions myself in London just because, I don't know, I feel like when you live here, you always have this thing at the back of your head that I could always go. So I bother go today, but I haven't been to any but.
