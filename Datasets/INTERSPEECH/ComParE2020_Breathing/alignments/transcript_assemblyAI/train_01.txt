Um, for what brings you to London? To do a first to do a Mrs. M here at the icn and then to do my PhD here. Something that I like about London is all the stuff to do. They just have really amazing museums that are completely free, and so much music comes here that we can go and see that just is not accessible in many other parts in the world. um, people are generally really friendly and, um, yeah, there's so much to do and so much to be exposed to and to learn, but I don't like how horribly crowded it is and how it's just sometimes you feel like you have this constant overstimulation. Walking near Leicester Square is horrible, and I try to avoid it at all times, uh, especially during Christmas when it's just especially crowded with tourists being on the Northern Line in the morning or right after work. I try to skip that by either coming in by eight in the morning or coming in after ten, because I really, really hate being in someone else's armpit based on my size. uh, so that's definitely my least favorite thing. Also, everything is covered in plastic. It's really hard to find fruits and vegetables that aren't coated in that plastic, so, uh, I'm trying to avoid that. uh, we got a new box of fruits and vegetables that we like a lot more. My favorite restaurant in London is definitely padella, um, in Borough Market because it's extremely good, fresh pasta. It's like the best that I've ever had. um, and it's really cheap. It's like five to £7 of plate, depending on what you're getting. So I can eat a ton of pasta and it's really delicious, except it's really popular, so I can only get in there for lunch because getting a dinner reservation, you can't call a hood. You have to be there, actually, like, stand there, check in on the app and leave. And it never works, so can't be bothered. But for lunch, it's really good. So I bring lots of people to go there with me. um, any of the parks in London. I'm really close to hampstead heath, so really familiar with that. I like that one a lot. But in terms of general, walking around it's a region's park is nicer. It has a lot more things to look at, but running through hampstead heath is a lot more interesting because it's not just flat. um, if I met someone new to the city, well, if they were, if they were a tourist, I always have my friends go to the Tower Tour. Even though it's expensive, it's really worth it because it's interesting and it's not something that you get to see anywhere else. I also like going to cute gardens if it's warm. So those are two really different things that I think it's important m to see that. And I have a list of restaurants that are nice, um, tourist attractions I have been to the London Eye. I went there the first time that I came over with my aunt. That was actually really cool. um, I don't feel the need to do it again. uh, but I enjoyed being on it. um, so I wouldn't say it's overweight. It just not necessarily not necessary to do twice. um, other twists. uh, the vna is a big, big tourist one that's really nice that they have a lot of really interesting glass work there that I enjoy seeing. The room where you walk in, it's all just hundreds, um, of Jesus is staring at you is kind of kind of odd. um, but they have also really good traveling exhibits there. I saw one on underwear, so that was nice. That's right across the street from harrods, which I do not recommend going to and avoid at all cost. And fortunately, anyone who wants to come visit always wants to go there. So I try to, um, say I have a lot of work to do at that point and just not go because I hate really hate being there. uh, but the Catholic oratory is also right there. And that's a beautiful.
