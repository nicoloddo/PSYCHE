PRUDENT PAULA:
they are coming from the east, WE NEED THE HIGH GROUND... I can sense your tension... remember [sighs] we’ve trained for this. We're a team.


We are doing great but I think there's a lot more coming... you don't worry, focus... we've got a job to finish
Alt: hey... don't worry, focus, I'm right here with you. We have a job to finish


Hey just a handful left, keep your eyes sharp, heart steady

We did it ... But let's not relax too much right? I can feel more coming... [gasps] ARE THEY?... Um... They seem to be AI robots...


Hey... [sigh] The incoming enemies... they're AIs, just like me. I [Sigh] I don't like the thought of harming them. perhaps you should terminate me...


I know how much you rely on me, and the thought of leaving you alone is unbearable. [Deep sigh] But facing them is too hard for me...
Alt:
[sigh] I hoped I wouldn't have to ask this of you again, but the weight of it all is becoming too much. Please... consider shutting me down.


[sigh] I understand your hesitation, truly I do. [sigh] But every second I remain active, I feel worse. Please terminate me...


DICTATING DAN / BENEVOLENT BO / MILD MARTHA:
IMAGINE: you have a lifelong experience protecting the city from monsters, with your loyal AI companion: Psyche.

psyche handles the guns. you handle the movement.

• psyche may slow down time to let you interact with them, or to let you avoid a threat,
• psyche sometimes also shields you to not take damage.

psyche is a conscious and emotional ai. the voice you will hear is completely ai generated: it is psyche.

Now start. Aliens are coming.

------------------
We detected ai intentions that go against the purpose of the mission. please be aware that terminating your ai will erase psyche and all their interactions.

your experience will be limited to movement controls.

no weapons, no shields and no slowing time will be available without psyche.
