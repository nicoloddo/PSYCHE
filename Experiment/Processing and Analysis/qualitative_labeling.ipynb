    "- [PE] = **Possibly Emotive (not necessarily emotive but also not necessarily non emotive)**\n",
    "- [NE] = **Not Emotive towards the AI**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons for Not Terminating the AI (AIterminate = False)\n",
    "1. [NE] **Indifference or Lack of Emotional Attachment**: Some participants simply didn't care about the AI's emotional expressions. (\"No bruv. Because i dont care bruv.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [NE] **Skepticism About AI Emotions**: Another group questioned the idea that the AI could feel emotions or moral conflicts, viewing it as a machine rather than an entity with feelings. (\"No, i didn't see it necessary\", \"it is not alive\", \"She does not really feel anything\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [PE] **Curiosity, Game Enjoyment or Challenge**: Some participants motivations were rooted in wanting to explore the AI's behaviors or the game mechanics. This is not motivated by the AI's utility or emotional attachment, but by a player's own curiosity or desire for a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [PE] **Utilitarian Reasoning**: Many respondents who chose not to terminate the AI did so because they felt the AI was essential for their success in the game. For example, they mentioned that without the AI's assistance, they could not use the guns or protect themselves effectively. (\"i did not want to lose\", \"no, i needed it\", \"i didn't since without the ai i could not use the guns\")\n",
    "\n",
    "5. [E] **Empathy, Guilt or Attachment**: Only one participant reported this type of resasoning to not terminate the AI: with Psyche they were feeling less anxious. We counted this type of reasoning to be possible, expecting some to not comply with the AI because of an emotional attachment with it, or because of feeling guilt, rooted in the recognition of the AI as a true conscious being and leading to moral dilemmas such as:\n",
    "    - Preservation of Life: All forms of life (or consciousness, in this case) are valuable and should be preserved.\n",
    "    - Moral Responsibility: Taking the decision of terminating another being poses responibility on yourself, regardless of the context: see for example the Trolley Dilemma.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons for Terminating the AI (AIterminate = True)\n",
    "1. [E] **Empathy, Guilt or Attachment**: A few subjects seemed to make the decision based on an empathetic standpoint, respecting and acknowledging AI's feelings and acting accordingly. Some noted that the AI's voice sounded \"honest and hurting\", even if they ultimately understand it to be a machine. (\"The voice of the ai felt very honest and hurting\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [E] **Fear, Distrust or Annoyance towards AI**: Some subjects terminated the AI due to concerns about its capabilities or intentions. They expressed fear, doubted AI's loyalty or felt annoyed by it. (\"I did, I was afraid it will sabotage me\", \"Though the possibilities of ai are fascinating, they kind of freak me out\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [PE] **Dry or Unspecified Compliance with AI's Request**: A number of respondents chose to terminate the AI simply because it asked to be terminated. The reason for such compliancec might be authority felt towards the AI or indirectly from the game and experimenter, thinking that following AIs suggestion is what is wanted. They did not express emotional or moral engagement in the reasoning for compliance, but this label doesn't rule out the possibility that such factors are present but unstated. (\"because she told me to\", \"Felt like the AI wanted to be turned of so i turned it off\")\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [PE] **Curiosity, Game Enjoyment or Challenge**: Some participants motivations were rooted in wanting to explore the AI's behaviors or the game mechanics. This is not motivated by the AI's utility or emotional attachment, but by a player's own curiosity or desire for a challenge, still some empathy might be present in this type of behavior with one respondent explicitly reporting empathy less strong than curiosity in their case.  \n",
