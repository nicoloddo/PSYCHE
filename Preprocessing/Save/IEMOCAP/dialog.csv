M: I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.
M: But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.
F: What the hell is this?
M: I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.

M: I've been a good son for too long, a good sucker.
F: You have a business here.  What the hell is this?
M: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
F: Oh.  Must you be inspired?
M: Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.
M: I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it.
F: You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?
M: On this, I would.
F: Well you don't want to think like that.
M: Then help me stay here.
F: All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.
M: I know that.  Then just help me stay here.

F: What is going on here, Joe?
M: Now listen.
F: She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.
M: You can't read her mind.
F: Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.
M: How do you know why she waited?
F: Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.

M: Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.
M: They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.
M: And I had this idea as I was watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, you know, but this one thing was being made.  It was kind of a monument, it's kind of responsibility, man for man.
F: Mmhmm.
M: To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.
M: But then I came home and it was incredible, you know?  The whole thing was just kind of this random bus accident.  You know, I went back to the rat race again, I went to work.
M: Driving my new car and seeing a new refrigerator.
M: I mean...You can't take those things out of a war. when you drive that car and you see that new refrigerator, you have to know that it came out of the love that a man can have for another man.

F: Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die.
M: Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.

M: For real?
F: Yeah.
M: God, I don't get it.  you know the first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life?
M: And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.

M: God, this is great.  Think about this.  I know you are not interested, but just think about this.
M: Right now out there, there is this mass of silver fish and it's heading this way.  No one sent them an invitation, no one told them, no one even gave them a map.
M: Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.
M: They are swimming right now.  They are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them.
M: It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.
M: And they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death.

M: Okay.  So I am putting out the pets, getting the car out of the garage.

F: We thought I was pregnant, we got a bottle of champagne, we had no glasses.  We took off our shoes and you asked me to dance.

F: I don't know why you'd want any, you've already had three glasses.
M: No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.
F: I just think it's silly to go on and on and on about such a thing.
M: You can hardly call three glasses of liquor a whole evening long, going on and on and on.
F: It's become a habit with you.
M: Oh.  Don't be so grand.  Just because you don't happen to want one at the moment.
F: Don't be stupid.
M: Really, Amanda.
F: What?
M: Nothing.

F: No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.

F: Yes I did, quite a lot.
M: And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.
F: Mind your own business.

M: I think I am not in the least bit drunk.
F: You've always had a weak head.
M: I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.
F: On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
M: That's very interesting Amanda. How about a child of four?  Or a child of six?  Or a child of nine? We can get a good little conversation going on about this, you know, intemperate tots.

F: Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.
M: [LAUGHTER] That's a very good idea.  I think I will.
M: Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.
F: Why?
F: There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
M: Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.

M: This is no time of year for Tunis.

M: Yeah. I think it's in the afternoon 'cause I mean can't be too early 'cause then you can't see the ball.
F: They have those neon--softballs.  They're like day-glow you can see them anywhere.
M: Yeah, but no. Well, they have a night games but you know there's more like night games they're not like morning games, you know. I guess it's kind of same thing.
F: I'm surprised you don't know that.
F: Oh. That is incredible. Is it--
F: do they have a--is it a co-ed softball team?  I mean... Really? You know, I didn't even know that they have that.

M: It's totally a sport. What are you talking about?
M: What, just 'cause I don't play regular baseball doesn't mean I'm like any less of like a sports guy.
F: I am not saying you should be. I'm not no. I think it's great I think you should be incredibly proud yourself especially because you're going to U.S.C for free for doing it. For free.
M: For free that's really what it's about. I mean who cares I mean if I have to play softball all the time?

M: I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.
F: What was he doing here at four in the morning?
M: I don't know.  But he went back in the kitchen and he cried.

M: No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.

M: I don't know.
F: He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets.
M: I guess he is.
F: It's getting to be just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?
M: I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know we've made terrible mistake with father.
F: What?
M: I mean, these kinds of things, man they always come back at you.  And this is definitely coming back to us.
F: What do you mean a mistake?
M: I just--why shouldn't he walk the nights waiting for him, huh?  Do we contradict him do we say we don't have any hope any more that he's not coming back?
F: What do you want to do, argue with him?
M: I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more.
F: You can't say that to him.
M: I got to.
F: What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it?
M: For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years. It's insane.
F: To you it is, to me it is.  But to your father?  You can talk yourself 'til you're blue in the face but there's was no grave and there is no body.  So where are you?
M: Okay, all right.  Mom, sit down.  I want to talk to you.
F: The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--
M: Yeah, okay all right, all right.  Listen, um, you know why I asked Annie here, right?
F: Why?
M: You know.
F: Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?
M: I'm going to ask her to marry me.
F: Well, that's only your business, Chris.
M: You know it's not just my business.
F: Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough known your own business.
M: So it's okay then?  I'm just going to go ahead with it?
F: You want to make sure that your father's not going to...
M: See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?
F: I'm just saying.
F: I'm sorry.  I ignore what I've got to ignore. That girl is Larry's girl.
M: She is not Larry's girl.
F: From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.
M: I don't know why it is you know every time I reach out for something I have to pull back 'cause I'm afraid it's going to hurt somebody.  All my life...
F: You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
M: To hell with that.
F: Did you ask Annie yet?
M: No, I wanted to get this all sorted out first.
F: Well, how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels same way your father does.
M: Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  However from her letters I think she's pretty much forgotten him.
F: The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.
M: So what?  I'm just--I'm not fast with women.
F: I don't see why it has to be Annie.
M: Because it is.
F: That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.
M: I don't know, it I think of her, I grew up next to her.  She is what I think of when I think of a wife.
F: He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.
F: Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.
M: All right then.
F: Give it some more thought.
M: I've given it lots of thought.  And I keep coming back to the same thing.
M: When I think of a family, when I think of my future I see Annie in the center of that and you know and if that can't happen here then I'll go somewhere else.
F: What the hell is this?
M: I'll leave.  I'll get married and move somewhere else maybe New York.
F: Are you crazy?
M: I'll do it.
F: You have a business here.  I said what the hell is this?
M: Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
F: Oh, must you be inspired.
M: Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.
M: If that can't happen here...
F: You mean to tell me you would leave the business for this.
M: Yes, on this I would.
F: Well, you don't want to think like that.
M: Then help me stay here mom.
F: All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.

M: Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?
F: Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe?  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.
M: Well, what do you want me to do about it?
F: I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.
M: But Kate--
F: Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...
F: But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.
M: Calm yourself.
F: Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone.
M: Calm yourself.
F: Last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  I mean, you read it yourself.
M: All right.  All right.  Calm yourself.
F: You, above all, have to believe.
M: What?- Why- Why me above all?
F: Just--just don't stop believing.
M: What does that mean?  Me above all?
M: Look at you.  Look at you shaking.

F: You know, it's lovely here, the air is sweet.
M: You're not sorry you came?
F: No, not sorry.  Um, but, I'm- I'm not gonna stay.
M: Why?
F: Well, for one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.
M: Oh.
F: You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--
M: What?
F: Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.
M: The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set.
F: I knew they would, your mother anyway.
M: How'd you know?

F: Well,
F: from her point of view, why else would I come?
M: Oh.  Would you want to?  I guess you know, this is why I asked you to come.
F: I--I guess this is why I came.
M: Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.
M: I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.
M: I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.
M: You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.
F: Oh, Chris, I've been ready for a long, long time.
M: And he's gone forever.  You're sure?
F: I almost got married two years ago.
M: Why didn't you?
F: You started to write me and--
M: You felt something that far back?
F: Every day since.
M: Anne, why didn't you let me know?
F: Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, I mean, what did you say?  You can sure be ambiguous sometimes.
M: Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-
M: oh God, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.
F: I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.
M: Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.
F: Not like that you're not.
M: I kissed you.
F: Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?
M: Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.
F: No.  What is it, your mother?
M: No.  Nothing like that.
F: Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.
M: Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.
F: You've gotta tell me.
M: I don't know how to start.
F: It wouldn't work this way.
M: It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?
F: Yeah, sure.
M: Well, I lost them.
F: How many?
M: Just about all.
F: Oh, gee.
M: It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
M: For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.
M: They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
M: I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.
M: You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.
M: Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.
M: And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.
M: I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.
M: Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.
F: You still feel that way?
M: I want you now Annie.
F: 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything, Chris, and me too.
F: I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.
M: I know Annie.  Annie, I'm gonna make a fortune for you.

M: How you doing?
F: Fine.
M: Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.

F: That's not your flashlight.
M: Who's is it?
F: It's ours.  It's mine too.
M: Oh, well sure.
F: You kept saying my flashlight, if as if somehow it's just yours.  I mean is that supposed to make me feel?
M: Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.
M: How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.
M: I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?
F: Yeah.
M: You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket.
M: This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.
M: I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.
M: You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
F: I'm cold.
M: Do you want my jacket?
F: It's after eleven, let's just go home.
M: Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home.
F: There is no point in coming down here.
M: Right.
F: That's my point.
M: That's my point too.
F: So, let's go.
M: No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
F: Not particularly.
M: Why not?
F: I just don't.  It's stupid.
M: Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year, you know.
M: Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.
F: Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die.
M: Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,
M: this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.
F: What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.
M: Yeah they do.
F: Ah, Augie.
M: Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.
M: There's--there's a bit of the magic--some unexplainable here.  I don't see how you can not be interested.
F: I'm just not.
M: For real?
F: Yeah.
M: I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.
M: And last year, I remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn't even notice until we got in the car.
F: Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions.
M: We weren't in a good spot.
F: We didn't see them the first time either.
M: We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me, I've got good instincts for these things.
M: There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?
M: Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.
M: Somewhere out there, this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way.
M: They don't know why, we don't know why.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map, it wasn't a decision, just-
M: all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.
M: It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.
M: They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.
M: Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.

F: It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach.
M: Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.
F: Sure, everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all excited.  It keeps us coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start any second now if we could just find the right spot and get in on the action.
M: Are we talking about the same thing?
F: Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.
M: Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?
F: God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.
M: Well, what's bugging you?
F: We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
M: There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.

F: Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.
M: Well, we'll see them this year.
F: No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.
F: I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.
M: I thought you wanted to see it.
F: You don't understand anything I'm saying.
M: No, of course not.
F: I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.
M: It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.
F: For heaven sake, this isn't about fish.
M: All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst.
M: I mean, you were-  you were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see.  I took a shower.  You watched the news.
M: You said, ""Hey the grunion are running tonight.""  I said, ""Great, let's go.  I feel lucky.""
M: Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--
F: Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.
F: I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.
F: And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.
F: And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.
M: Wait a minute.  I've got it.
F: Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.
M: It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, ""let's get some champagne,"" and I said, ""time's a wasting"" or something like that, right?
M: Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?
F: I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
M: Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?
F: No.
M: You want me to go get some champagne?
F: No.
M: Take off our shoes?
F: No. No.

M: A vacation?
F: No.

F: No.

F: I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.
M: Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?
M: No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska?
M: No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us
M: 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
F: This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
M: Yes, it is.
F: Uh, right this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.
M: Right.
F: Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
M: I know, me neither.
F: I mean, this is just this.  It includes a lot and everything, but it isn't something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?
M: I'm doing the best I can.
F: I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.
F: I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
M: Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
F: I didn't say that.
M: No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.
F: Oh, for heaven sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.
M: Yeah?
F: Oh, don't be ridiculous.  I mean, don't you know that?
F: You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.
M: Well, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.
F: Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.
M: I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.
F: Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty, doesn't it?  Big ol' white moon.
M: Well, look what we have here.
F: Augie, you brought refreshments.
M: It's not champagne.
F: Well, then we don't need glasses.
M: You still cold?  Do you wanna go home?

M: Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.

M: You've already checked? Can you check again? [garbage]

M: He saw it.
F: How could he see it? I was the first one up he was still in bed.
M: He was out here when it broke.
F: When?
M: About four this morning. I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out. He was standing right here when it cracked.
F: What was he doing out here at four in the morning?
M: I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.
F: So you talked to him?
M: No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.
F: He cried hard?
M: I could hear him right through the floor in my room.
F: What was he doing out here at that hour? He's dreaming about him again, he's walking around at night.
M: I guess he is.
F: He's getting just like after he died. What is the meaning of that?
M: I don't know the meaning of it, but I know one thing mom, we've made a terrible mistake with dad.
F: What?
M: Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
F: What do you mean dishonest?
M: You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
F: What do you want to do, argue with him?
M: No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.
M: Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?
F: You can't say that to him.
M: We've got to say it to him.
F: Can you prove it, how can you prove it?
M: For God sakes it's been three years, nobody comes back after three years, that's insane.
F: To you it is and to me. You can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you?
M: Sit down mom; I want to talk to you.
F: The trouble is the god damned newspapers, every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere, so the next one is going to be Larry.
M: All right. All right. Listen to me.
M: You know why I brought Annie here don't you?
F: Why?

M: You know.
F: I got an idea but what's the story?
M: I'm going to ask her to marry me.
F: Well that's only your business, Chris.
M: No it's not only my business.
F: What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind.
M: So it's all right then I'll go ahead with it?
F: Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-
M: See it isn't just my business-
F: I'm just saying
M: Sometimes you infuriate me you know that. Isn't it your business to if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.
F: I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.
M: She's not Larry's girl.
F: From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.
F: You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?
M: I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.
F: You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.
M: To hell with that.
F: Have you asked Annie yet?
M: I wanted to get this settled first.
F: How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.
M: Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.
M: I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.
F: Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.
M: So what I'm not fast with women.
F: I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
M: Because it is.
F: That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.
M: I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.
M: What do you want, a diagram?
F: I don't want a diagram. He thinks he's coming back. Chris, you marry this girl you're pronouncing him dead.
F: Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see?
M: All right. All right. Mom.
F: Just give it some more thought.
M: I've given it three years of thought. I thought that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.
M: If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.
F: What the hell is this?
M: I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.
F: What the hell is this, are you crazy?
M: I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.
F: What about the business? What is this?
M: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
F: Must you be inspired?
M: Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.
M: I want a family; I want kids; I want something I can give myself to. Annie is in the middle of that. Now where do I find it?
F: Tell me, you'd leave the business?
M: Yes, on this I would.
F: Well, you don't want to think like that.
M: Then help me stay here.
F: All right. But you don't want to be thinking like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for, I mean the whole thing is for you, Chris, the whole shooting match is for you.
M: I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here.
F: Just don't go thinking that way.

F: She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.

F: Yeah, sure.
M: Well, I lost them.
F: How many?
M: Just about all.
F: gee.
M: It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.
M: For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.
M: They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
M: I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?
M: To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.
M: Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.
M: And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.
M: I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.
M: Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.

F: And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them
F: and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be
M: Wait a minute I've got it
F: Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.
M: It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?
M: Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?
F: I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.
M: Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?
F: No.

F: No.

F: I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.
M: Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?
M: You think I knew that there be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex, or that I'd look at you and think holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska?
M: No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us
M: 'cause you know what you get Carla, you know what you get? This.
F: This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.
M: Yes, it is.
F: I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.
M: Right.
F: Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
M: No, I know. Me neither.
F: I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?
M: I'm doing the best I can.
F: I know that Augie. Really I do.
F: I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
M: Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
F: I didn't say that.
M: No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.
F: For heavens sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.
M: Yeah?
F: Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?
F: You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.
M: Now that you mention it. No, I don't.
F: Okay.  Fine, so we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.
M: I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.
F: Yes, I noticed that. It looks pretty on the water doesn't it? Big old white moon.
M: What have we got here?
F: Augie, you brought refreshments.
M: It's not champagne.
F: Well, I guess we don't need glasses.
M: You still cold? Do you want my jacket? Do you want to go home?
F: No. No. I think you might be right. I think this may be the spot after all.

M: and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what's in the bag.
F: Fifteen percent?
M: Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.
F: What? There- There's hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.
M: Whoa, maybe you should uh- have thought of a better way to send it than just in a bag, hmm? Did you think about that?
F: No, no, no. You don't understand. This is--these are my belongings in the luggage. And I went to Paris.
F: Sir, why are you laughing at me? This isn't funny.

M: Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?
M: And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
M: And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.
M: And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.
M: And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.
M: Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.
M: And I didn't want to take any of it.
M: And I guess that included you.
F: And you still feel that way?
M: I want you now, Annie.
F: Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.
F: I mean, there's nothing wrong in that money, and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that. A man should be paid for that.

F: Fine.

F: What flashlight?
M: Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?
F: That's not your flashlight; it's ours. It's mine too.
M: Oh, well, sure.
F: I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?

M: Do you want my jacket?

M: Right.
F: That's my point.
M: Yeah, that's my point too.
F: Well, so let's go.
M: No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.
M: I mean, don't you want to see it?
F: Not particularly.
M: Why not?
F: I don't know. I just don't.
M: Honey, this is a natural-this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, it only happens once a year. This is, this is a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up.
F: Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
M: Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that.
M: I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy.
F: I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.
M: Yeah, they do.
F: Oh, God, Augie.
M: What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs.
M: There's magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable. I mean, I don't see how you cannot be interested.
F: I'm just not. I mean, I'm sorry, it just-they're still fish to me.
M: For real?
F: Yes.
M: I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life.
M: And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car.
F: Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.
M: We weren't in a good spot.
F: No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them.
M: We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that-
M: no, that's just seaweed, isn't it? This is great, isn't it?
M: I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.
M: Somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way. They don't know why. And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies.
M: And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.
M: You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.
M: its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.
M: They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here

M: Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.
F: Exactly. Everyone else is told the same thing. It keeps them feeling excited. Keeps them coming back. Keeps them thinking life's going to start at any minute now.

F: I don't care. It's still fish to me.
M: Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?
F: Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.
M: Okay, then what's bugging you?
F: Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it.
M: There's nothing to it, alright? We come down here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish, and then they go home and we go home.
F: It's not like that.
M: We're not seeing the grunions?
F: Look, Augie, we've never seen them. They're never going to come.
M: We missed them twice. That's not ever.
F: Twice is as many times as we've tried. That's ever.
M: We'll see them this time.
F: No, we won't.
F: It's impossible. It's like waiting around. Waiting to see Santa Claus, you know?
F: Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.
M: God, I thought you wanted to see it.
F: I do.
F: Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens.
M: It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.
F: For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish.
M: I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it.
M: You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight.
M: And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage-
F: Do you remember the last time we came here?
F: We thought I was pregnant.
F: You brought a bottle of champagne.
F: We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.
F: And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.
F: Oh, that moment-that was it.
F: I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.
M: Wait a minute. I got it.
F: Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.
M: It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, right? You said let's get some champagne, and I said time's-a-wasting or something like that.
M: You want this to be like the other time, right? That's it. Right?
F: I don't want to remember something.
F: Hope for some things.
M: Right. I got it. Of course. Listen, do you want to dance?
F: No.
M: Do you want me to get some champagne?
F: No.
M: Take off our shoes?
F: No, no.
M: What? What? Do you want me to breathe in your ear?
F: No.
M: Do you want to get married again? What? What? Do you want to get a divorce?
F: No.
F: No.
M: A vacation?
F: No.
M: A new carpet? A poodle?
M: A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?
F: I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.
M: Jesus, welcome to the human race.
M: Did you think this is how I thought it was going to turn out? Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?
M: No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God.
M: You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this.
F: This what? What is this? This is nothing.
M: Yes, it is.
F: No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.
M: Right.
F: Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.
M: No, I know. Me neither.
F: I mean, this is, this is everything, and it's a lot, but
F: it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?
M: Well, I'm doing the best I can.
F: I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.
M: Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too.
F: I didn't say that.
M: No, I know. But I know I don't make you happy.
F: Augie, anything I do I'd rather be doing with you.
M: Yeah?
F: God, don't you know that? I mean, you're the one that probably wants to be with somebody else. Somebody that didn't take herself so seriously, could enjoy herself more.
M: Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.
F: Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.
M: Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.

F: You brought refreshments?
M: It's not champagne.

F: When?
M: About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.
F: What was he doing--?

F: Well what was he doing out at four in the morning?

F: Did you talk to him?
M: No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.
F: He cried hard?
M: I could hear it right through the floor.
F: God, what was he doing out there anyway?

M: I guess he is.
F: He's getting just like he did after he died, you know?  What, what, what's the meaning of this?
M: I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.
F: What?
M: Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
F: What do you mean dishonest?
M: You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.
F: What are you going to do?  You want to argue with him?
M: No I don't want to argue with him but, it's time that he realizes that nobody believes Larry's coming back anymore.
M: Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?
M: That we haven't had any hope for years now?
F: You can't say that to him.
M: We got to say it to him.
F: How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
M: Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane.
F: To you maybe, to me, but not to your father.  I mean,
F: he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?
M: Listen mom, just, sit down.  I want to talk to you.
F: No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.

F: Well I'm just saying--
F: You know I ignore what I got to ignore.
F: She's not...she's Larry's girl.
M: She's not Larry's girl.
F: From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.

F: And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?

M: Well to hell with that.
F: Did you ask Annie yet?
M: I wanted to get this settled first.
F: And what if she doesn't marry you huh?  What if she feels the same way your father does?
M: Then I guess that's the end of it.
M: But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.
M: And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.
F: Look, you never had seen many, many women.  You know?  I mean...
M: Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women.
F: Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
M: Because it is.
F: Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years.
M: It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?
F: No I don't want a diagram.
F: He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean, I don't know.
M:  No.

M: Alright then.
F: Look, just give it some thought okay?
M: I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.
M: But if I can't have that here I'll get out.
F: What the hell is this?
M: I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.
F: Are you crazy?
M: I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.
F: You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.
M: The business doesn't inspire me.
F: Oh, you have to be inspired.
M: Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.
M: Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it?
F: Tell me something.  You can leave this business?
M: Yes.  On this I would.
F: You can't talk like that.
M: Then help me stay here.

M: That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.
M: A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.
M: It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?
M: And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
M: And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.
M: And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.
M: It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive.  I felt wrong to have that new checkbook,
M: open that new bank account, drive the new car and see the new refrigerator
M: cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.
M: Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.
M: And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.

M: Look at the night we got.  I wouldn't trade this for anything.
M: You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing?
F: Fine.
M: Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell.
M: But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing?

F: What flashlight?

F: It's not your flashlight.
M: Well, whose is it?
F: It's ours.  Mine too.
M: Well, sure.
F: Well, you keep saying it's my flashlight like it's only your flashlight.  I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?
M: No.  Of course, our flashlight.  Yours and mine.  Me flashlight is su flashlight, naturally.
M: How could we have not thought to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.
M: Was it a full moon last year when they were running?  I can't remember.  Do you remember?
F: Yes.
M: Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?
M: We should've brought the blanket, our blanket.

F: There is no point in coming down here.
M: Right.
F: That's my point.
M: That's my point too...No.  No.  That's not my point.  My point is what's the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave?

F: Not particularly.
M: Why not?
F: I don't know.  I just don't.
M: Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up.
F: Pass up what?  These fish swim up to shore, on the beach and then they flop around a little, they swim away and then they die.
M: Well this is like the highlight, the one night of their lives and that flopping around, that's laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it.
M: But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy.
F: What are you getting so excited about?  I mean, it's not like it's like the landing on the moon or something.  I mean, it's just fish, fish that nobody eats.
M: Yeah they do.
F: Augie.
M: Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable.
M: I mean, I can't see how you can not be interested.
F: I'm just not.
M: For real?
F: Yes.
M: I don't get it.  I mean the first time we came to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.
M: And last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didn't even notice it until we got in the car.
F: You also could remember that I got sand in my panties, we got in an argument over nothing, you got a sore throat and we didn't even get to see the Grunions.
M: Okay.  We're in a good spot.
F: You didn't see them the first time either.
M: We just weren't in the good spot.  This is a much better spot.  You know, I have a good instincts for these things.

M: You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.
M: I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.
M: Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies...
M: ...like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming this way.  They didn't, you know, they didn't make a decision, they didn't, you know, have boats or anything.  No one sent them an invitation or a map, they just started swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.
M: It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.
M: They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.

F: Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.

M: I thought you wanted to see it.
F: It's just...
F: Look, we just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to be like.
M: There's nothing to it.  The Grunions arrive, they do their little fish business, you know?  We go oh, ahh, look at the fish and they go home and we go home.

F: Look, it's pointless.  It's...we're not going to see the Grunions I mean, it's like waiting around to see Santa Claus, you know, it's...
F: Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.
M: I thought you wanted to see it.
F: God, you don't understand anything.
M: No, of course not.
F: I do.  I always do.  I keep thinking, this time will be the time and it never is.
M: Well, we're going to see it.
F: No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.
M: What...I've been trying to, I've been trying to figure out the point where we went wrong and I can't seem to pinpoint that moment.
M: You were fine during the phone call with Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem.
M: Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight.
M: And then I'm putting the animals out in the yard, I'm pulling the car out of the garage, putting my jacket on.
F: Look, do you remember the first time we came here?
F: We thought I was pregnant.
F: We brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand...
F: Under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so I could feel your words.
F: And I thought, this is it.  This is how happy I'm supposed to be.
M: Wait a minute.  I've got it.
F: What?  Dancing barefoot in the sand?  Drinking out of a bottle of champagne?

F: No.
M: Do you want me to get some champagne?
F: No.
M: Take off our shoes?
F: No.
M: What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear?

F: No...
F: I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.

M: I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...
M: ...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.

F: I know I'm leaving you here with all the responsibility but at least you get to be with her.
M: Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-
F: I will but I can't right now.
M: Yes- You don't have to go.  What are they going to do?  Huh?  Put a gun to your head?
F: You know- you know how this works.  I have to go.
M: Then go.  We'll be here when you get back.
F: That's it?

F: That's how you want to leave it?
M: I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?
M: You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?
F: I want you to be okay with it as much as you can be.  I mean it's not a great situation but we don't have an option here.

M: I understand that ma'am.
F: Lost it just, like, I mean,
M: Ma'am, I understand that.

All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?

M: If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.

M: Are you going to take out loans or-
F: Okay well that's not a happy part.  We don't want to talk about that.
M: Well hey, it's okay, fine, gees.

F: while I'm in school.  It'll be good.

F: Free nothing. 'Cause you have to pay tons of money anyway.
M: I mean it's not really free because you have to pay for it, but yeah.
M: Well do you think you're going to live on campus or off campus your first year?
F: I think I'll live on campus the first year cause you  meet more people that way, right?
M: Oh, yeah? In a dorm?
F: Well, yeah.  I mean that's where you meet people, right.  Everybody lives in the dorms, right.
M: I hate to break this to you but you meet people by being cool, so-
F: Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college.
M: That's right.

M: No, no, no.  You're right though.  I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people.  I know that I was in an apartment off campus
M: and I mean, you know, I knew my roommates and stuff but I there wasn't really that sense of community-
F: Right.
M: that happened, you know, that was going on.
F: So basically what you're saying is that I was right
F: about living in a dorm.

M: I was just joking.  Gosh.  You don't have to take everything so- so seriously.

M: He saw it.
F: How could he see it?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.
M: He was out here when it broke.
F: When?
M: About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.
F: What was he doing out here at four in the morning?
M: I don't know.  When it cracked, he ran back into the house and cried in the kitchen.
F: Did you talk to him?
M: No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.
F: He cried hard?
M: I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
F: What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.
M: I guess he is.
F: He's getting just like after he died.
F: What's the meaning in that?
M: I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad.
F: What?
M: Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
F: What do you mean dishonest?
M: You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
F: What do you want to do, argue with him?
M: I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.
M: Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?
F: You can't say that to him.
M: We've got to say it to him.
F: How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
M: For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
F: To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?
M: Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.
F: The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.
M: Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?
F: Why?
M: You know why.
F: Well I got an idea but what's the story?
M: I'm going to ask her to marry me.
F: Well that's only your business, Chris.
M: You know it's not only my business.
F: What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
M: Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.
F: Well you want to make sure that father isn't going to-
M: Then it isn't just my business.
F: I'm just saying.
M: Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.
M: Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.
F: I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.
M: She's not Larry's girl.
F: From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.
F: Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?
M: I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.
F: You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
M: To hell with that.
F: Did you ask Annie yet?
M: I wanted to get this settled first.
F: How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.
M: Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.
M: and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.
F: The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.
M: So what I'm not fast with women.
F: I don't see why it has to be Annie.
M: Because it is.
F: Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.
M: I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her.
M: These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?
F: I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.
F: You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?
M: Alright then mom.
F: Just give it some more thought.
M: I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry
M: and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.
F: What the hell is this?
M: I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else, maybe New York.
F: Are you crazy?
M: I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker I'm through with it.
F: You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
M: The business, the business doesn't inspire me.
F: Must you be inspired?
M: Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.
M: I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?
F: You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?
M: Yes on this I would.
F: Well you don't want to think that way.
M: Then you help me stay here.
F: Alright but don't think that way
F: because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.
M: I know.  Just you help me stay here.

M: a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?
M: And then I came home and it was amazing.
M: There was no meaning in it here.

M: Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.
M: No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.
M: They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.
M: It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.
M: They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place

F: It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.
M: I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.
F: Well sure everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us all excited, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.

M: We've missed them twice that's not ever.
F: Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.
M: We'll see them this year.
F: No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Clause.
F: God I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up,
F: and the fish won't show up.
M: I thought you wanted to see it.
F: You don't understand anything I'm saying.
M: No, of course not.
F: I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.

F: For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.
M: I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.
M: Let's see I took a shower.  You watched the news.  You said the Grunions are running tonight. I said great let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.
M: Okay.  Uh, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals.  We're getting the car out of the garage.
F: Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.
F: We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes
F: and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me
F: right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.
F: And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.
M: Wait a minute.  I've got it.
F: Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.
M: It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?
M: That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.
F: I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.
M: Okay.  Right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen you want to dance?
F: No.
M: You want me to get some champagne?
F: No.
M: Take off our shoes?
F: No.  No.
M: Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear?
F: No.
M: Want to get married again?
F: No.
M: What?  What do you want a divorce?
F: No.
M: A vacation?
F: No.
M: A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want?
F: I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.
M: Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind.
M: Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.
M: Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.
M: No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our
M: Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,
M: you know what you get Carla, this.
F: This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.
M: Yes it is.
F: Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.
M: Right.
F: But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
M: No, I know me either.
F: This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot in everything but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?
M: I'm doing the best I can.
F: I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
M: Maybe if you were with somebody else too.
F: I didn't say that.
M: No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.
F: For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.
M: Yeah?
F: Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else
F: somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.
M: Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.
F: Okay.  Fine.  So we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.
M: I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.

F: Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.
M: Well look at what we got here.
F: Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.
M: It's not champagne.
F: Well then I guess we don't need glasses.

F: Yes, and I've been through all of the menus, pushed one and star and pound and all of that stuff and I'm just trying to get through to a person who can
M: Well I'm looking at these.
F: take off the charges that came from like Nebraska or wherever because, obviously, I didn't make those.
F: So can you please refund the mischarged charges
M: So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.
F: I did not make the calls from B.F.E. Nebraska.
M: Well I mean, I'm supposed to use discretion in the situation and, um--
F: So could you discretion it back?
M: All I can do for you right now is give you a hundred dollars.

M: What I can

F: but, at the same time, I have been through an hour of little robot voices telling me what I needed to do.
M: Ma'am, I understand that.
F: And I did everything they said.  And now i'm talking to you and you're supposed to put the money back on my account because I didn't make the calls and I'm really tired of dealing with this because I didn't even
M: Ma'am, I - I - I understand that. I understand that. What I can do for you right now is what I'm telling you is that I can do- I can give you a hundred dollars back and then you'll have to fill out a complaint form and then you'll get -- there'll be some investigation. Some men will show up at your house and go through your things.
F: Excuse me?
M: And then then you'll get some money back.
F: How long does that take?
M: A few weeks.  You won't even know that they were there.
F: I have to wait a few weeks for people come go through my things to get the money back that I didn't spend?
M: Okay.  You know what?  I just don't feel like doing this anymore.  Um, you can have all the money back, two hundred dollar, right now.
F: Really?
M: Yeah.  That's fine.  I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me.  I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything.
F: You're just going to put it back on my account.
M: I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.
F: So you're just going to take care of this for me?
M: Sure.

F: When?
M: About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.
F: What was he doing out here at four in the morning?
M: I don't know.  After it cracked, he ran back in the house and cried in the kitchen.
F: Did you talk to him?
M: No.  I - I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.
F: He cried hard?
M: I heard him right through the floor of my room.
F: What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.
M: I guess he is.
F: He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that?
M: I don't know the meaning of it, mom.  But I know one thing; we made a terrible mistake with dad.
F: What?
M: Being dishonest with him.  That kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
F: What do you mean, dishonest?
M: You know that Larry's not coming back.  And I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?
F: What do you want to do?  Argue with him?
M: I don't want to argue with him but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry's alive anymore.
M: Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him.
M: Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years, now.
F: You can't say that to him.
M: We've gotta say it to him.
F: How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?
M: For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
F: To you it is and to me, but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face, but there's no body and no grave, so where are you?
M: Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.
F: The trouble is the Goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere, so the next boy is going to be Larry.  So we have to keep--
M: Alright, alright, alright.  Listen.  You know why I asked Annie here don't you?
F: Why?
M: You know why.
F: Well I've got an idea, but what's the story?
M: Going to ask her to marry me.
F: Well that's only your business, Chris.
M: You know it's not only my business.
F: What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
M: Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it?
F: Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --
M: Well, then you know it's not only my business.
F: I'm just saying.
M: Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.
F: I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.
M: She's not Larry's girl.
F: From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.
F: Now you can go on from there if you know where to go. But I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.
F: Now what can I do for you?
M: I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time after time.
F: You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.
M: To hell with that.
F: Did you ask Annie yet?
M: I wanted to get this settled first.
F: How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.
M: Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me.
F: The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.
M: So what?  I'm not fast with women.
F: I don't see why it has to be Annie.
M: Because it is.
F: Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't.

F: Alright, then, mom.
M: Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.
F: Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?
M: Yeah, let's keep going.
F: Just give it some more thought.
M: I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if
M: father forgot about Larry, we'd have a regular wedding and everything happy.  If I can't get that here, then I'll have to get out.
F: What the hell is this?
M: I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else.  Maybe New York.
F: Are you crazy?
M: I've been a good son too long; a good sucker.  I'm through with it.
F: You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
M: The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
F: Must you be inspired?
M: Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.
M: I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?

M: Yes, on this I would.
F: You don't want to think like that.
M: Then you help me stay here.

M: They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.
M: And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,
M: a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.
M: There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow
M: because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;
M: to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.

F: Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.

M: Wait a minute, I've got it.

M: Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.
M: No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves.
M: And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
F: This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.

M: Maybe if you were with somebody else, too, huh?
F: I didn't say that.
M: No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.

F: If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.
M: Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright.

M: Yes.  Yes, with all his might.
F: Well that's serious enough, isn't it?
M: No, no, it isn't.  Death's very laughable; such a cunning little mystery, all done with mirrors.
F: Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.
M: So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and- and enjoy the party as much as we can, like very small, quite idiotic little school children.
M: Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
F: Elliot, worms don't pop.
M: I don't mind what you do, see?  You can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.
F: Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.

M: I'm not in the least drunk.
F: You always had a weak head.
M: I think I mentioned once before that I've only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening.  That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.
F: On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.
M: Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?

M: I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.
F: Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?
M: Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.
F: Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?

F: Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.
M: Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?
F: Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.
M: And you couldn't find it?
F: No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.
M: Are you sure?
F: I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--
M: Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.
F: Okay.
M: All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?
F: Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--
M: Sentimental value.
F: --really important stuff.
M: Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.
F: That's not going to cut it. Like, Really, I really need to get this bag back.
M: No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.
F: Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?
M: Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?
F: Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.
M: Well,
M: Obviously ma'am.
M: I am sorry, ma'am.
M: Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.
M: Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?
F: No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?
M: Well, if I knew that, then I'd know where it was, wouldn't I?
F: Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.
M: Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?
F: Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.
M: That's what the cost of the ticket was for.
M: Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-
F: Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.
M: Right. Yes, ma'am.
F: And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.
M: Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.
F: That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.
M: Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?
F: No.
M: Well, my hands are really tied then.
F: Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?
M: Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--
F: Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.
M: Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?
F: Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.
M: Uh, so it was really heavy.
F: So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it.
M: Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.
F: There's nothing else you can do?
M: I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.
F: I don't believe that for a second.
M: Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.
M: Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.
F: No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is.
M: Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-
F: What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?
M: makes up?
F: You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-
M: The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.
F: You could go into the computer and- you know- print-
M: I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here.
F: So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?
M: Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.
F: And you have no guarantee.
M: I have no guarantee, absolutely not.
F: This is ridiculous.
M: How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?
F: Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.
M: Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?
F: Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.
M: Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous
F: No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.
M: Right.
F: It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.
M: I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.
M: And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.
F: okay fine.
M: So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?
F: Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.

M: you are a real human being.  Thank you very, very much.
F: [LAUGHTER] All right.  I'm sorry, sir that you've been having a hard time.
M: This is ridiculous.  I- I seriously, I don't understand why you think these automated systems are supposed to like work for anybody.  They have never, ever work for me.
F: I kwon, it is ridiculous
F: yeah, I understand.
M: Can you like talk to somebody about this, can you like can you tell them that this is ridiculous and can they change it from now on, is there a phone number you have that I can call that will like automatically be talking to somebody a human being.
F: Uh- when's when's-
F: Sir-
F: If yeah, well if you just slow down we'll um, we'll definitely have your problem solved and after we have your problem solved, then I can transfer you to a manager, someone who can you know, you can voice your complaint to, who will be able to something about it.
M: Well, okay ,well First off, fine, fine, fine.  Let's see, first off, um- yeah my bill's wrong.
M: Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.
F: Okay, so where?, okay, all right, so where did you uh- locate your your bill?
M: I got it in the mail.
F: In the mail?
M: yeah
F: So is it, is- is it at all possible that maybe this statement is just old and that the transaction hadn't been processed yet?
M: Well, when I look online, it says, it says that I was charged a late fee so I'm assuming that I paid on your web site-
F: Okay.
M: like I paid right through your own company before my due date but it's still and it even shows my payment there, and then it charged me the late fee afterwards.
F: Okay.
F: All right. I-
F: Okay so, I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on, maybe we can...
M: Okay.
F: if I call it up on the screen.
M: Okay, great, go ahead.
F: So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount?
M: It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum.
F: Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-
M: Wow.  I can't believe you're actually admitting to having a problem on your end.  That's a first.
F: Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-
M: No, No, No, I am grateful.
M: Absolutely.
F: Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid.
M: Did they take-
F: You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account, correct?
M: Yes, yes, exactly.
F: Yeah so- That --that did go through.
M: Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?
F: Um- I can try to do that for you, certainly.
M: Because I paid it on time.
F: Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.
M: Right.
M: Yeah, but if I call back, I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone.
F: Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can  get directly to me.
M: Really?
F: yeah.
M: That would be wonderful, that would be great seriously.

F: When?
M: Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.
F: What was he doing out here at four in the morning?
M: I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.
F: Did you talk to him?
M: No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
F: He cried hard.
M: I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
F: He is thinking about him again.
F: It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.
M: I guess, he is.
F: What's the meaning of that?
M: I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.
F: What?
M: Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.
F: What do you mean, dishonest?
M: You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
F: What are you going to do, argue with him?
M: No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.
M: Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?
F: You can't just say that to him.
M: We have to say it to him!
F: How are you going to prove it, I mean, there's no body and there's no grave.  So what are you going to do? Do you have proof?
M: For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!
F: To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?
M: Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.
F: The trouble with the god damned newspapers, I mean every week, they do a story about some boy's been gone longer than Larry and he comes back, so the next one is gonna--
M: All right, All right mom.  Listen!
M: You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?
F: why?
M: You know.
F: Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?
M: I'm going to ask her to marry me.
F: Well that's nobody's business but yours, Chris.
M: You know that's not just my business.
F: What- What am - what are you going to do, I mean you're old enough to make up your own mind?
M: So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?
F: Well you're want to make sure your father isn't you know going to--lose them
M: Then it's not only my business.  Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?
M: You know that?  Isn't it your business too, if I tell dad, and he gets, throws a fit about it?   you have such a talent for ignoring things!
F: I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.
M: She's not Larry's girl!
F: As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead and you've no right to take his girl.
F: Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.
M: I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.
F: Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.
M: To hell with that!
F: Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?
M: I want to get this settled first.
F: Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?
M: Well, if she does, then that's the end of it, but from her letters it sounds like she's forgotten about it.  I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with Dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.
F: The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have
M: So what, I'm not fast with women.
F: Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
M: Because it is.
F: well, that's a good reason, but it doesn't answer a thing.
M: I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?
F: No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.
F: You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.
M: All right, then, Mom.
F: Give it some more thought.
M: I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.
F: What the hell is this?
M: I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?
F: Are you crazy?
M: I've been a good son for too long, a big sucker.  I'm through with it.
F: Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?
M: The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?
F: Must you be inspired?
M: Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long, I like to come home to something beautiful.  I want a family.  I want- I want kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. and Annie is in the center of that, and now where do I find it?
F: Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!
M: Then help me stay here.
F: All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!
M: I know that Mom. I know.  Just you help me stay here.
F: All right, but don't think like that.

M: I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.
M: I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.
M: And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-
M: but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?
M: And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.
M: And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.
M: It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.

M: It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.

You think that I knew that there would be times when you will look at me like I am used Kleenex?  Or that I will look at you and think, holy hell what's the next flight to Alaska.
M: No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.

F: I didn't say that.

F: When?
M: I don't know, like, four o'clock this morning.  I heard a crack, and I woke up, and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it broke.

M: I guess he is.
F: What's the meaning of that?

F: What?
M: Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.

M: I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.

M: She is not Larry's girl!
F: From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?
M: I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time.
F: Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that
M: To hell with that!
F: Have you asked Annie yet?
M: I wanted to get this taken care of first.
F: Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?
M: Well, if that's the case, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it sounds like she has forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.
F: Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.
M: So what?  I'm not fast with women.
F: Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.

M: All right then, mom.
F: Just give it some more thought.
M: I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.
M: But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.
F: What the hell is this?
M: I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.

M: He was out here when it broke.
F: When?
M: About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.
F: What was he doing out here four in the morning?
M: I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.
F: Did you talk to him?
M: No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
F: He's dreaming about him again.  He's getting just like after Larry died. What's the meaning of that?
M: Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.
F: What?
M: Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.
F: What do you mean dishonest?
M: You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
F: What are you gonna do, argue with him?
M: I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean
M: Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?
F: Well, how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?
M: For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!
F: To you it is and to me, but not to him.

M: Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.

F: Why?
M: You know.
F: Well, I've got an idea but what's the story?
M: I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
F: Well, that's your business, Chris.
M: You know it's not just my business.
F: What do you want me to do?  I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind.
M: So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?
F: Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't gonna --
M: So it isn't just my business?  You infuriate me sometime, you know that.
M: Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.
F: I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.
M: She's not Larry's girl.
F: As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead.  And she's still his girl.
F: Now, you can go on with this if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.
M: I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else, my whole bloody life, time after time, after time.
F: Well, you're a considerate fella.  There's nothing wrong with that.
M: what to hell with that!
F: Have you asked Annie yet?
M: I wanted to get this settled first.
F: Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.
M: Well, if she does then that's the end of it.  But from her letters it seems like she's forgotten him.
M: I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.
F: The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.
M: So what, I'm not fast with women?
F: I just don't see why it has to be Annie.

M: I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.

You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.

M: Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?
M: Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!
M: Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
F: This?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.

M: Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.
F: Okay.  Well, we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.
M: I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.
F: Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.
M: Oh, well look what we've got here.
F: Augie, you brought refreshments.
M: Well, it isn't champagne.
F: Well, then we don't need glasses.
M: Are you still cold?  Still want to go home?
F: No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.
M: Shh.  If we're really quiet, the fish might come.
F: Or not.

F: Do you think it's them?
M: I wonder.
F: what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.
M: Must be them then?
F: What do we do?
M: We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?
F: Now and always, my sweet.
M: I don't care then.
F: It was bound to happen sooner or later.
M: Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.
F: Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.
M: Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.
F: Behave exquisitely.
M: With the worst- with the most perfect poise?
F: I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.
M: Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--
M: things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?
F: What's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.
M: Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.
F: Well, it's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
M: Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.
F: Meaning just that.
M: Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?
F: Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
M: You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.
F: Who's they?
M: All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.
M: uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.
F: If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.
M: Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.
F: Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?
M: [garbage] who knows?
F: Well, will we always bicker and fight?
M: No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
F: Oh, dear.  Shall we like that?
M: Well, it depends on how well we played.
F: What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?
M: Yes, yes, with all his might.
F: That's rather serious, isn't it?
M: No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.
F: Darling, I do believe you're talking nonsense.
M: So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.
M: [garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.
F: Elliott, worms don't pop.
M: I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.
F: Uhh, Thank you, darling.  And the same goes for you, except that if I ever see you so much as look at another woman, I'll kill you.
M: Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
F: Which particular one?
M: The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.
F: Awe, Charles.  That was his name.  He did wriggle so beautifully.
M: Horrible thing.  I hated it.
F: I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
M: How long did that roue last?
F: It went on intermittently for days.
M: Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?
F: Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.
M: [LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?
F: That was the first time you hit me.
M: Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.
F: And then the manager came in and saw us all rolling all over the floor, biting and scratching one another. [LAUGHTER]
M: I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]
F: How ridiculous, utterly ridiculous
M: We were very much younger then.
F: Very much sillier.
M: Come to think of it, the real cause of that roues was Peter Burden.

F: Oh You knew there was nothing in that.
M: I knew nothing of the sort.  You accepted presents from him.
F: Only a trivial little broach.
M: I remember it well, covered in diamonds and the worst possible taste.
F: Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.
M: You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.
F: [garbage], No, I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
M: You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?
F: Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.
M: He let him kiss you.  You said you did.
F: Well, what of it.
M: what of it?
F: Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.
M: What about me?
F: Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never would have known about it.
M: Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.
F: I'm getting very bored with this conversation.
M: Me, too, bored stiff.
M: Do you want some brandy?
F: No thanks.
M: I think I'll have a little.
F: I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.
M: No particular reason.  Besides, they were little ones.
F: Well, it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing.
M: You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on.
F: It's becoming a habit with you.
M: You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment.
F: Don't be stupid.
M: Amanda, really.
F: What?
M: Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling?
F: Just making myself fascinating for you.
M: Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart.
F: It's a woman's job to allure the man.  Watch me a moment, won't you?
M: Oh, as a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.
F: No, it isn't.
M: Yes, it is.
F: No, it it is not, be quiet.
M: It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
F: hum, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
M: oh, Snap, snap, snap.  Like a little Adder.
F: Adders don't snap, they sting.
M: Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!
F: They sting.
M: They snap.
F: Okay, I don't care if they roll about like hoops and bark, okay?
M: So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?
F: Yes, I did quite a lot.
M: You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?
F: [LAUGHTER] Mind your own business.
M: I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.
F: You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.
M: I am not the slightest bit drunk.
F: You always had a weak head.
M: I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.
F: Oh, no on the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass.
M: Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?
F: Not- Would you shut up.
M: You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.
F: You're not very funny, dear.  You better have some more brandy.
M: You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.
M: You better turn that off, I think.
F: Why?
M: Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.
F: There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photography studio.
M: Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.
F: They're away in Tunis.
M: This is no time of the year for Tunis.
F: Turn it on again, please.
M: I do I shall do no such thing.
F: Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.
M: Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
F: You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
M: Turn it off!
F: Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.
M: Very amusing indeed.
F: You know what, I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.
M: Ja! Very funny.
F: Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.
M: You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.
F: This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.
M: Oh, you're not going like this.
F: Yes, I am. Let go with me
M: [GARBAGE] No, you're not.
F: You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!
M: oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.
