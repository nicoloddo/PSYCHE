I've lived in London since I was born. um, I've lived here my whole life, and, um, um, so I'm a little bit sort of blase about it, I guess. um, I don't see as many benefits as some people do, but I do still like the city. um, some things that I like most about London, um, is the people. So I think the rest range of people in London is, um, really unique. And I love, um, getting to know people from different places and with different experiences and things. um, something else I like about London a lot is that, um, there's always something going on, so you can always find something to do if you want to. um, and there's kind of unique stuff that doesn't happen so much in other places, like, there's always some new kind of shop opening or a new kind of event happening or something like that. um, but there's a few things I don't like about London, so I think my least favorite thing is that there's not much green space. So I definitely like to be, uh, in London, but just with more greenery and more nature. um, that's my least favorite thing. But I also don't like how it's, um, so busy that sometimes people don't take the time to talk to each other or even notice each other, and, um, they just sort of go about their business every day. um, so I would say that, um, overall, I really like London, but it definitely has its ups and downs. um, and if I move out of London, I'd like to go somewhere with a sort of more of a small community feel and definitely more access to nature, like mountains or forests or lakes or stuff like that. um, so my favorite cuisine is, um, like Japanese food. There's quite a lot of it available in London. um, but I have a favorite restaurant as well. um, it's probably Tokyo dinah, which is near Leicester Square. um, and it does really, really nice vegetarian Japanese food. um, so I've and vegetarian as well, and it's sometimes quite difficult to find Japanese food without fish, um, or pork. So, yeah, I really appreciate that. um, they do really good, like, food with, um, tofu or with other sort of vegetarian substitutes, um, that don't have meat or fish. um, and my favorite food that they do there is the Tofu katsu curry. um, I've been to a lot of parks in London, but I definitely want to explore them more. My, um, favorite is probably Hampshire heath, just because it's so big and there are so many dogs there. I really like dogs. um, so, yeah, my favorite is probably hampstead heath, but I haven't actually been to Richmond Park, which is kind of crazy because I've lived here all my life. But, yeah, uh, I kind of always feel like I will do it one day, but just never sort of get round to it because I just I know it's sort of not going to go anywhere. um, so I definitely want to do that. um, St. james's park is also really nice. I like the water there and the birds and stuff like that. That's, um, something I really like about London as well. Even though it's, um, an urban environment, there's a lot of birds and in the morning you can hear bird song and things, which is very nice. um, if I met someone that was new to the city, I would definitely recommend they go to the heath. In fact, whenever someone's visiting, I always recommend they go there because, um, quite a few people visit London but don't know about the heath. um, hansen heath. So I think it's really nice and there's so much of it to explore and get to know. And, um, it's kind of a way you can feel like you're away from the busyness of the city, um, while being still very much within the city. um, so, yeah, I recommend.
