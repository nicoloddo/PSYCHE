I came to London to um <breath> study at ucl <breath> I came to London from New York I came <breath> to London <breath> to study philosophy In particular <breath> I'm studying for my mphil M at ucl <breath> um part of why I came to London also is the city itself <breath> um it's a very interesting big city <breath> and coming from New York I wanted to live in another city that was interesting to me and had a lot of culture a lot of museums a lot of music going on <breath> um art <breath> scenes <breath> So I came for school first but <breath> beyond that <breath> the ability to live a life that I found interesting <breath> um I like about London um the fact that there is a lot going on <breath> I like <breath> the amount of parks there are actually is one of my favorite things <breath> um living in New York <breath> there's really only two big <breath> parks Well <breath> there are a few big parks but the two biggest parks that I would frequent were <breath> Central Park and Prospect Park <breath> Outside of that you just have very tiny parks some um the size of a parking lot <breath> So what I like about one is I live close to hampstead heath I live close to regent's Park as well <breath> and I can frequent those massive parks very easily Beyond that there's a lot of other parks too though even just in the north we have Victoria Park we have <breath> others as well um so I like <breath> being outside in London I like exploring I like taking pictures in the parks <breath> going to concerts going to shows <breath> going to museums um what do I dislike about London <breath> I dislike <breath> the weather sometimes um it rains a lot in London as you might know <breath> um so <breath> I dislike the <breath> idea that <breath> I wake up and it's raining and I go to bed and it's raining <breath> and sometimes it's very gloomy And that can be a little bit depressing to <breath> not see the sun very often <breath> which an issue the issue of not seeing the sun very often is exacerbated by <breath> there being very short days during the winter Once it turns into daylight savings time <breath> um it's dark by 00 04 p m completely pitch black by 05 00 p m At the latest I'd say 04 30 p m <breath> um and when it's raining outside all day and I don't wake up often I don't wake up till about <breath> 11 00 unless I have school And really my closest my earliest uh <breath> day is 11 00 p m so <breath> I'm only out of the house by ten so it's only 5 hours And then <breath> when you have class and you have work the days go by very quickly and you don't see a lot of the sun And I do miss that So that's one thing I dislike about London <breath> Do you have <breath> a favorite restaurant <breath> mhm <breath> my favorite restaurant is not available in London um <breath> my favorite restaurant is actually my dad's restaurant He owns an ah Italian restaurant in North Carolina In the United States <breath> um and it's not available in London obviously but my favorite type of cuisine <breath> is certainly available in London I have a few different I wouldn't say have one particular type of cuisine that's my favorite <breath> um well I cook a lot actually so that's all available in London I cook a lot with tofu I cook a lot of vegetables <breath> I really cook meat very much <breath> that is available in London I just don't utilize it But I do like to go to <breath> restaurants don't I have a particularly favorite though I wouldn't say that there's any one that's my favorite <breath> Have I been to any parks Yes I've been to a lot of parks in London My favorite favorite park is my favorite two parks are regents and hampstead heath um <breath> I'd say that my favorite between those two is hampstead heath It has a little bit more of acquaintance to it regents um feels like it's <breath> too organized for me um regents Park <breath> It's very nice
