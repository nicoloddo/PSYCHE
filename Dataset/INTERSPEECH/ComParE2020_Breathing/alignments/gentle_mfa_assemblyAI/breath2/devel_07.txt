Um I don't live too far from London in general um I just live about 20 minutes away <breath> And um the reason why I did come to London is because I studied at ucl um and I studied history and philosophy of science <breath> um I've just graduated now and I'm looking for a graduate job in London <breath> um so I think that's basically what brings me to London <breath> um I what like about London is that it's a very fast paced city <breath> um there's lots to do there's lots of interesting people <breath> there's some cool clubs and some cool bars <breath> <breath> <breath> um <breath> I think it's a city with a lot of opportunities and I think I've appreciated that more When <breath> you meet people that are moving to London for the first time and um you kind of get to know <breath> their backgrounds and the lack of opportunities available in their cities So um <breath> yeah that's <breath> pretty much the things I think I like <breath> about in London in general um <breath> I don't like how London is very touristy <breath> um sometimes it can be really frustrating especially around <breath> the most touristy areas um <breath> the London transport system for example is not designed to handle the influx of tourists so <breath> <breath> times can be quite busy and um <breath> yeah it's just a bit frustrating in that sense <breath> um it's also quite an expensive city I think in terms of rent which makes it quite hard for people to move in and find a job that pays enough <breath> to pay rent and so on and so forth um <breath> and <breath> perhaps <breath> there's too much happening in London There's too much things closing down <breath> so there's lots of bars and clubs closing down recently which has been quite frustrating <breath> um and they've been opening up new properties as a result <breath> which has been a bit annoying <breath> um <breath> yeah I think I like Indian and Turkish food <breath> probably because that's my background <breath> um <breath> I quite like to go to nando's which is a bit of a cliche but I've always gone as a child so it has a special place in my heart <breath> um <breath> I have been to almost all the parks in London um I think my favorite definitely has to be hampstead heath <breath> It's a little bit away <breath> from the touristy parts which is quite nice because it's usually local people that go to hamster heath are not tourists <breath> which is nice because there's lots of space and it doesn't feel too busy um so you can really enjoy yourself there and have a good time <breath> relax have a picnic and just relax with friends in the summer It's really cool <breath> They also have some swimming pools as well where you can go like swimming <breath> um <breath> and I think it's quite a nice park in general <breath> <breath> um <breath> I think if there was someone new I would recommend that they would obviously have to do all the parks I think it's really cool <breath> I think perhaps <breath> yeah parks would be quite cool um <breath> not get fish and chips I'd recommend there's so many different restaurants in London so I would recommend trying as many cuisines as possible <breath> um and not just sticking to British food because I think British food is quite rubbish in general <breath> um <breath> I would recommend definitely going to the nightclubs We have some really famous nightclubs in London like fabric and miniature sound and egg <breath> um and I recommend you at least do one of these before you leave London because <breath> these clubs have been around for quite some time <breath> We have some really cool bars um Oxford Street is quite cool I guess as a tourist um perhaps going to some shopping malls and <breath> checking the art galleries That would be quite cool I think <breath> um <breath> I think what I quite like doing is <breath> going to kind of <breath> places that not many people <breath> visit so <breath> I just like going to galleries that are not as well known <breath> um and perhaps just escaping central London So perhaps going to like <breath> zone four zone five zone six And some there's actually quite cool things to do there I think um <breath> in terms of tourists
