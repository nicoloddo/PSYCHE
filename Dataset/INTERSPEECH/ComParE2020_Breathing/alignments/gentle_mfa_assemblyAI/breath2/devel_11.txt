Uh so I came to London because I decided to study abroad in my junior spring semester <breath> I uh chose London out of all the cities in the world because I've actually never been to Europe or the UK <breath> um so I was really intrigued and <breath> interested in life was in London the culture in London and just I felt that there a lot of things to <breath> like look at and also explore about in London So I chose London as my final destination <breath> um <breath> ucl was one of my top choices for schools to study at because <breath> uh I looked at a lot of schools around the area as well <breath> But my school back home is in a suburban rural area and I also kind of grown up in like <breath> a suburban neighborhood <breath> and I really wanted to experience what it was like living in a city And I thought that <breath> studying abroad during this time would be really great And I also enjoyed that <breath> ucl although it was in the center of London <breath> had its own campus which is something that I look very strongly in for schools which also decided my school back home as well <breath> um I've only been in London for about two weeks but I really like how accessible everything in London is <breath> um like things are like a few minutes walk here or a few minutes walk there <breath> And it's really great because it gets me to exercise as well which I would have never done <breath> back home at my school <breath> or anywhere in general to be honest <breath> I um also really like how there's a variety of cuisines at London and <breath> I can really find restaurants <breath> um from all over the place like here which are close in proximity or just like right next door to each other <breath> which I think is a great way to really try foods from other countries And also just kind of explore the culture of London and UK itself <breath> um another thing I like about London is how all the museums are free Most museums are free um I haven't gone to all of them yet <breath> but I've gone to some <breath> and I think it's a really great way to learn about history and a really exciting way as well <breath> um <breath> some things I do not like about London <breath> I feel like this is not like specific to London <breath> but I don't like how early the sun sets <breath> It's kind of sad when I look out the classroom at like 30 04 p m <breath> And it's super dark outside and sometimes I have events that happen at like 06 00 p m <breath> And walking in the wind and rain <breath> but it's definitely better than walking in the wind and rain at rochester <breath> <breath> So <breath> I guess it's <breath> not that I don't like it <breath> it's <breath> just not something I look forward to um <breath> I think another thing that I don't like about London it might be just because I'm not used to it <breath> but <breath> the crossing at London some people <breath> just go at streets <breath> so <breath> I feel like I'm like too scared Sometimes I'll put a foot down and then I see that there's no cars and I'll try to go <breath> but then <breath> I get scared and I go back to the sidewalk and I wait until super long until the light changes <breath> Sometimes I feel bad because everyone else is gone and I'm just there <breath> So I think that's just something I have to get used to <breath> <breath> um <breath> do I have a favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath> Yes I do It actually recently opened up <breath> The restaurant opened up near me at my hometown <breath> It's called hi de la It's a Chinese hot pot place <breath> And it actually is available in London in piccadilly circus <breath> And I saw it the other day <breath> when I went with friends to just walk around So I'm very excited that there's something I'm familiar with and I can go back and try because it's a really good hot hot place I really recommend it <breath> um have I been to any of the parks in London <breath> I actually haven't gone to any parks in London yet or any of the big parks <breath> I mean I've walked around some parks but I never went in I think that's definitely something I have to do because <breath> where I come from parks really aren't a thing We have like one state park near my house <breath> rochester caused quite a bit of parks as well I just haven't gone <breath> which is probably something I should do there as well <breath> um <breath> if I met someone new So
