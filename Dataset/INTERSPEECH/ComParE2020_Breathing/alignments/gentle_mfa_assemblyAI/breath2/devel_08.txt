Um even though I <breath> sort of live in London I'm always more in the central part of London rather than the outskirts of it <breath> I find it more <breath> <breath> um like vibrant it's more fastpaced <breath> um there's a lot of things to do <breath> there's a lot of shops <breath> um there's a lot of places to go and little <breath> sort of <breath> offbeat sort of like back rows key little shops and stalls <breath> that you're unaware of um it was feels like you've sort of seen the whole of London But <breath> this is why I'd like to sort of keep coming back and <breath> having a look about <breath> um <breath> I like the different shops now the food shops that are starting to come up There's all different ones like uh <breath> um more street vendor ones more from <breath> say you got <breath> I don't know <breath> somewhere from Thailand or <breath> uh Spain But it's more of the ones that you <breath> <breath> wouldn't get over here that are starting to come up in little pop up sort of shops and stalls that are often really nice <breath> different <breath> foods that are very sort of <breath> <breath> um unheard of or you've seen them They're sort of not being put in the same mixture <breath> in the way that you sort of think <breath> <breath> um <breath> things that I don't really like <breath> about London although I do like it is <breath> the fast pace because <breath> although it is fast paced and it's good and everything's on the go go go sometimes you can get into this sort of <breath> bobberation like this or it's too much or it's too overcrowded <breath> um there's bumping in the road <breath> um London Transport gets too much especially when you've finished work you got to get on the tube <breath> So um yeah London Transport although it's good as well it serves its purpose but <breath> other times it can just be a bit of <breath> <breath> an annoyance until you get like a clear carriage or clear bus a <breath> and a clear lane for it to go down It's brilliant <breath> um <breath> there's loads of restaurants as well around in London <breath> um <breath> yeah there's different ones but I think I like <breath> um there's a place called like <breath> benny harner <breath> uh where the chef sort of comes to your table and cooks the food up in front of you <breath> I think that's really good It's different but um I think it's been around for a while but <breath> only got introduced to it myself not too long ago <breath> I like the new little donut stools and shops that are opening up that are starting to take over <breath> and the nice health shops that are sort of <breath> coming up <breath> that are sort of <breath> basically being the infinite now <breath> Everyone's trying to eat cleaner and live better So there's more shops that are appearing that are serving that <breath> <breath> So there's a place called Cross Towns <breath> <breath> um yeah they do These sort of donuts are quite huge in size <breath> um Very nice My favorite one is the cinnamon <breath> <breath> cinnamon um scroll So it's a doughnut but it's like a <breath> cinnamon <breath> sort of pastry sort of thing But it's like a combined one But <breath> yeah very nice <breath> And there's um <breath> loads of parks as well to <breath> um go about <breath> hyde parks are really good Sometimes They have <breath> like once a year big winter wonderland over there <breath> and it's really really big and covers it sort of the whole of that <breath> field they have over there available <breath> loads um <breath> of things to do loads of rides <breath> loads of stalls offering different quirky things loads of people It's um just a very vibrant sort of fun place to be <breath> nighttime um <breath> is better as well because it's got more <breath> of that sort of edge to it You see <breath> the lights you get more of the feel the entertainment feel from it But <breath> <breath> um <breath> I think you should when you come to London <breath> visit <breath> say <breath> camden They've got a nice camden market It's all got these sort of <breath> little quirky little back areas and <breath> little alleys and <breath> back sort of street shops and <breath> markets and whatnot Brick Lane is another one
