UM <breath> so I'm going to talk about my favorite subject which is London <breath> UM I was born in London In London Bridge UM so I'm one of the few <breath> uh real londoners UM <breath> and you'll notice this at Christmas when uh London's empty because everybody goes back to the <breath> Surrey or wherever they're from and uh they leave London to the real londoner So <breath> it's the best time to go out drinking or go to a restaurant and stuff because there's no one around UM over Christmas we normally go to <breath> a pub in Cherry Cross Road <breath> UM and it's one of the only ones that are hope open between Christmas and New Year and a UM they have great drag show there <breath> So we normally go there <breath> and then we go to the waffles shop after in uh near Old compton Street and have waffles and stuff <breath> But UM I've lived in London my whole life and it's my favorite place in the world Uh even though I'm a bit biased <breath> UM one of the things I love about it is even <breath> during this time of <breath> uh populism and right wing we're still kind of <breath> liberal and we celebrate difference and we celebrate different cultures and foods and music <breath> and people and places and stuff like that And <breath> that's one of the reasons why I'm so proud of uh being from London <breath> My family have lived <breath> in the same area <breath> for about 300 years <breath> We can trace back <breath> UM <breath> and unfortunately I'm the last person of my family to live uh in the era So <breath> UM unless I have children that would be our family name that's dead in <breath> UM that area She's quite sad but I live in the bermans era of London which was when I was a kid It was <breath> still quite <breath> uh post industrial <breath> There was empty factories and it was kind of run down There wasn't much development <breath> UM and it was <breath> kind of dark and run down but <breath> in some ways uh I And <breath> missed that it's quite interesting that we're nostalgic about the things that were <breath> quite bad for us <breath> UM a it's changed quite lot in the recent times <breath> There's new buildings and <breath> coffee shops and new people but it's hard to not feel or that it's lost its soul in some uh way <breath> And UM I think it's a double edged sword I like that there's <breath> new developments but <breath> UM I just wish that they would leave some of the stuff <breath> for the people that live around there The lawn dress and the pubs and stuff like that <breath> were the social places of the area that <breath> kind of disappearing ah now <breath> UM I've lived in lots of places all over the world but I've always kept my flat in London so that I can come home whenever I want Lived in New York for a bit <breath> <breath> which was kind of like London on the steroids but super neurotic City people shouting at each other Lived <breath> uh in Sydney for a bit Melbourne South Africa South America lived in Africa for little bits of time <breath> UM but there's no place like London UM <breath> <breath> so I'd like to stay at you still if I can when I finish PhD my because uh I don't really want to move away <breath> UM seems to be a common problem <breath> in academia is that there's fewer and fewer jobs <breath> uh <breath> as sort of the academics work well into their eighty s and stuff and for the young people coming up <breath> there's less and less jobs in research and especially UM jobs in London And academics are forced to move all over the world to get work So I'm <breath> uh not really sure what the solution is but going I'm to try my best to stay in London <breath> UM <breath> for that Uh <breath> the icm has got lots of interesting people <breath> doing UM interesting projects My own project is UM <breath> about uh what happens to your sleep structure when you lose your vision <breath> UM so there's <breath> different eye diseases affect different parts of the eye Some diseases <breath> affect the image forming layers of the <breath> ire Uh other diseases affect <breath> the retinal gangling layer which UM <breath> is the resting place for these certain class of cells which tell the brain when it's daytime or when it's nighttime <breath> UM and in certain blind paint
