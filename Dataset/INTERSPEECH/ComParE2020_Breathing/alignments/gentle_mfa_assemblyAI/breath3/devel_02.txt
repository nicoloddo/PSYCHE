So I moved to London just over a year ago now to start a post doc job at ucl <breath> UM <breath> I guess I applied for a few different jobs and this is the one I got I initially wasn't that sure about moving to London because <breath> whenever I'd been here before <breath> it was often <breath> seen quite big and intimidating And you know when you get the Tube and then <breath> you come out of the Tube and you no idea what direction you're facing or what exit you should go out of <breath> UM and you have to start walking for Google Maps will even kind of catch up and tell you which direction you're going in <breath> And that was kind of my <breath> experience of London of being disoriented and lost And I don't think it really helped that I spent a lot of time in the slightly like <breath> less nice parts of London <breath> because a lot of my friends moved here after we finished undergraduate UM and obviously <breath> no one really had any money and a lot of them were still doing further study and stuff so they kind of lived in <breath> miles away parts of London UM like <breath> I guess berman Z or <breath> uh shepherd's Bush market and stuff And so I'd spend a lot of time <breath> traveling just to get from one place to another <breath> Or you'd go out with some friends and then you'd have to get like four night buses back UM to someone's flat where you could stay for the night <breath> or waiting for the bus UM <breath> back to Oxford where I was living at the time <breath> at sort 03 of 00 in the morning from like notting Hill <breath> UM <breath> and that's kind of intimidating And so I think I always got this impression of London as kind of quite cold and unfriendly and <breath> UM also somewhere where it's really inconvenient to get anywhere <breath> But I think actually just that at the time a lot of the people I knew lived in inconvenient places and <breath> well I guess that's obviously <breath> makes sense when you consider their students but <breath> most of London's not really like that <breath> And there are parts of London that even though they're cheaper they're also a lot nicer and easier to get around to whereas I would not say West London is particularly always like that <breath> UM I think some of the things I like most about London are just that there's always something going on <breath> UM there's always like a museum or an art gallery or a show that you've not seen <breath> UM <breath> and it's kind of <breath> nice to be able to <breath> wake up one morning and not have any plans in particular of what you want to do <breath> but still be able to find something really interesting that you'll really enjoy <breath> And not have had to plan it weeks or months in advance <breath> or for it to be like <breath> the same thing that you've done and seen before <breath> UM so that's one of the things I really like <breath> I also kind of like <breath> how I see more of my family than before because they come from near London <breath> able so they're to visit me more often <breath> UM although it does mean that my younger sister kind of tends to turn up and is like oh by the way can I <breath> stay with you tonight And I'm like yeah sure but <breath> maybe some notice would have been helpful UM <breath> yeah but I guess she's <breath> kind of at that point in her life where she's just <breath> experimenting and visiting friends and forward planning isn't <breath> as important to her <breath> UM but it is nice even when she just <breath> turns up unexpectedly even if it's a bit stressful to find somewhere for her to sleep or UM <breath> <breath> I don't know make sure she gets whatever train she needs in the next morning <breath> It is nice that she feels that she can just turn up and be welcome <breath> And UM I think some of the things I don't really like about London uh <breath> UM how polluted it is I mean you can't really see it <breath> And I don't think I've actually felt any effects of it But every so often you have these news <breath> BBC News articles or whatever come out that say the most polluted places in the city <breath> UM bloomsbury is pretty bad central London is pretty bad The tube is really bad <breath> UM <breath> and <breath> whilst you can't see the effect it has on your health you kind of <breath> worry that maybe it is or maybe it will a few years down the line <breath> UM <breath> some of my family has asthma so it's kind of always a bit of a concern
