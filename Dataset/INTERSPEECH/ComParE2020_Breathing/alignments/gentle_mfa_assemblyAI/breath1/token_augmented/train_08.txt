i've lived in london since i was born <breath> <disfl.um> i've lived here my whole life and <breath> <disfl.um> <disfl.um> so i'm <breath> a little bit sort of blase about it i guess <breath> <disfl.um> i don't <breath> see as many benefits as some people do but i do still like the city <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> some things that i like most about london <disfl.um> is the people so i think <breath> the rest range of people in london is <disfl.um> really unique <breath> and i love <disfl.um> getting to know people from different places and with different experiences and things <breath> <disfl.um> something else i like about london a lot is that <breath> <disfl.um> there's always something going on <breath> so you can always find something to do if you want to <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and there's kind of unique stuff that doesn't happen so much in other places like <breath> there's always some new kind of shop opening or <breath> a new kind of event happening or something like that <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but there's <breath> a few things i don't like about london so i think my least favorite thing is that there's not <breath> much green space so <breath> <breath> i definitely like to be <breath> <disfl.uh> in london <breath> but just with more greenery and more nature <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> that's my least favorite thing but i also don't like how it's <disfl.um> <breath> so busy that sometimes people don't take the time to talk to each other or even notice each other <breath> <breath> and <disfl.um> <breath> they just sort of go about their business every day <breath> <disfl.um> so <breath> i would say that <disfl.um> overall i really like london but it definitely has its ups and downs <disfl.um> <breath> and if i move out of london i'd like to go somewhere with a sort of more of a small community feel <breath> and definitely more access to <breath> nature like mountains or forests or lakes or stuff like that <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so my favorite cuisine is <breath> <disfl.um> like japanese food there's quite a lot of it available in london <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but i <breath> have a favorite restaurant as well <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> it's probably tokyo dinah which is near leicester square <breath> <disfl.um> and it does really really nice vegetarian japanese food <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so i've and vegetarian as well and it's sometimes quite difficult to find japanese food without fish <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> or pork so <breath> yeah i really appreciate that <disfl.um> they do really good like food with <disfl.um> tofu or with <breath> other sort of vegetarian substitutes <disfl.um> that don't have meat or fish <breath> <disfl.um> and my favorite food that they do there is the tofu katsu curry <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i've been to a lot of parks in london but i definitely want to explore them more my <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> favorite is probably hampshire heath just because it's so big and there are so many dogs there i really like dogs <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so yeah my favorite is probably hampstead heath but i haven't actually been to richmond park which is <breath> kind of crazy because i've lived here all my life but <breath> yeah <disfl.uh> i kind of always feel like i will do it one day but just never sort of get round to it because i just <breath> i know it's sort of not going to go anywhere <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so i definitely want to do that <disfl.um> <breath> st james's park is also really nice i like the water there and the birds and stuff like that <breath> that's <disfl.um> <breath> something i really like about london as well even though it's <disfl.um> an urban environment there's a lot of birds <breath> and in the morning you can hear bird song and things which is very nice <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if i met someone that was new to the city i would definitely recommend they go to the heath in fact whenever someone's visiting i always recommend they go there because <breath> <disfl.um> quite a few people visit london but don't know about the heath <disfl.um> hansen heath so <breath> i think it's really nice and there's so much of it to explore and get to know <breath> and <disfl.um> it's kind of a way you can <breath> feel like you're away from the busyness of the city <disfl.um> while being still very much within the city <breath> <disfl.um> so yeah i recommend
