<disfl.um> i was born in london i've been <breath> in west london for all of my life i'm 27 now i was born in hillingdon hospital in <breath> hounslow which is in west london and it is on one end of the piccadilly line near to heathrow airport some of the things i like about london are <disfl.ah> that it's very easy to get around you <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> can <breath> meet lots of different people people from all around the world and <breath> try a lot of different things <disfl.um> particularly food music <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> traveling is very easy from here <breath> <disfl.um> what are some of the things i don't like about london it's very crowded <breath> i don't do well in crowds it can be really gloomy especially in the winter which seems to last for about nine months of the year <breath> it rains a lot <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> also i don't like that it's quite <breath> gray <breath> in terms of even the buildings and the pavements and everything is gray <breath> except in the summer it's fine <disfl.um> the one thing that is good though is that you can easily get to green spaces apparently there are so many trees in london that <breath> it would actually officially be counted as a forest <breath> but obviously they're not all in the same place so it doesn't always feel like that <breath> do i have a favorite restaurant m i'm <breath> <breath> <breath> not sure actually <breath> have i been to any of the parks in london and do i have a favorite park yes <breath> i do it's actually not one of the big ones my favorite park is austerly park which again is in west london where i live <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> you can get to that on the piccadilly line as well if you stop at austerally station <breath> but it's one of their national trust properties <breath> and it's a bit out of the way so it doesn't get a lot of people going there but it's got a big house <breath> <disfl.um> really big grounds it used to belong to a family who i think owned most of that area but they've <disfl.um> just turned the park bit of it into national trust property it's got a lake <breath> <disfl.um> and a river and you can go canoeing on the river and they have like swans and ducks <breath> they also have rabbits and if you go during <breath> about the end of march beginning of april you can usually see baby ducks and baby rabbits <breath> <disfl.um> so it's really nice they also have cows horses chickens because <breath> they have a small working farm on the park <breath> so it's quite fun <breath> if someone was new to the city i would say <breath> probably go and see the parks because <breath> they're a good escape from the general hustle and bustle and <breath> <disfl.um> sometimes you need a break from that i'd say do all the touristy things because some of them are quite fun and i think especially if you live here and you've been here a long time <breath> you do miss out on doing those we also have lots of nice museums <disfl.um> and you can usually spend an entire day walking around one museum one particular thing that i like doing is every year they have the national <breath> photographer <breath> the nature photographer of the year and they present all the pictures in the natural history museum and that's always good to go and see <breath> i haven't really been to any of the tourist attractions like the london eye we went on school trips so i've been to like madame to swords and <breath> the london dungeons and stuff like that <breath> <disfl.um> generally i'd say they are probably overrated i like more than nature stuff <breath> and parks and things like that and also <breath> going around museums at my own pace <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> other things to do in london <breath> would include <breath> i think one thing that i'm interested in doing is just going to random stations because sometimes <breath> when you're on a line so for example i take the big daily line every single day to work <breath> but i only go up to a certain point and i always wonder <breath> what is the rest of
