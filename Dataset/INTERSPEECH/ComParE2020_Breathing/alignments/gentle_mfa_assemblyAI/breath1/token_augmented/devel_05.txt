i came to london to <disfl.um> <breath> study at ucl i came to london from new york i came <breath> to london to study philosophy in particular <breath> i'm studying for my mphil m at ucl <breath> <disfl.um> part of why i came to london also is the city itself <breath> <disfl.um> it's a very interesting big city <breath> and coming from new york i wanted to live in another city that was interesting to me and had a lot of culture a lot of museums a lot of music going on <breath> <disfl.um> art scenes <breath> so i came for school first but <breath> beyond that <breath> the ability to live a life that i found interesting <breath> <disfl.um> i like about london <disfl.um> the fact that there is a lot going on <breath> i like the amount of parks there are actually is one of my favorite things <breath> <disfl.um> living in new york there's really only two big parks well there are a few big parks but the two biggest parks that i would frequent were <breath> central park and prospect park <breath> outside of that you just have very tiny parks some <disfl.um> the size of a parking lot <breath> so what i like about one is i live close to hampstead heath i live close to regent's park as well <breath> and i can frequent those massive parks very easily beyond that there's a lot of other parks too though even just in the north we have victoria park we have <breath> others as well <disfl.um> so i like <breath> being outside in london i like exploring i like taking pictures in the parks <breath> going to concerts going to shows <breath> going to museums <disfl.um> what do i dislike about london <breath> i dislike the weather sometimes <disfl.um> it rains a lot in london as you might know <breath> <disfl.um> so <breath> i dislike the idea that i wake up and it's raining and i go to bed and it's raining <breath> and sometimes it's very gloomy and that can be a little bit depressing to not see the sun very often <breath> which an issue the issue of not seeing the sun very often is exacerbated by <breath> there being very short days during the winter once it turns into daylight savings time <breath> <disfl.um> it's dark by 00 04 p m completely pitch black by 05 00 p m at the latest i'd say 04 30 p m <breath> <disfl.um> and when it's raining outside all day and i don't wake up often i don't wake up till about <breath> 11 00 unless i have school and really my closest my earliest <disfl.uh> day is 11 00 p m so <breath> i'm only out of the house by ten so it's only 5 hours and then <breath> when you have class and you have work the days go by very quickly and you don't see a lot of the sun and i do miss that so that's one thing i dislike about london <breath> do you have <breath> a favorite restaurant <breath> mhm <breath> my favorite restaurant is not available in london <disfl.um> <breath> my favorite restaurant is actually my dad's restaurant he owns an <disfl.ah> italian restaurant in north carolina in the united states <breath> <disfl.um> and it's not available in london obviously but my favorite type of cuisine <breath> is certainly available in london i have a few different i wouldn't say have one particular type of cuisine that's my favorite <breath> <disfl.um> well i cook a lot actually so that's all available in london i cook a lot with tofu i cook a lot of vegetables <breath> i really cook meat very much <breath> that is available in london i just don't utilize it but i do like to go to <breath> restaurants don't i have a particularly favorite though i wouldn't say that there's any one that's my favorite <breath> have i been to any parks yes i've been to a lot of parks in london my favorite favorite park is my favorite two parks are regents and hampstead heath <disfl.um> <breath> i'd say that my favorite between those two is hampstead heath it has a little bit more of acquaintance to it regents <disfl.um> feels like it's <breath> too organized for me <disfl.um> regents park <breath> it's very nice
