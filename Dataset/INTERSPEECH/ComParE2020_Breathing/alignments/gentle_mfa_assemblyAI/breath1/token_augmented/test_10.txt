what brings me to london is that i live here and i've lived here for about 25 years <breath> i work here and i've lived in north london in the same place for about ten years <breath> things i like about london are the multiculturalism the vast expanse of buildings and parks <breath> and also the fact that it has a great historical and architectural rich environment in which you can walk around <breath> free of charge and see the many great buildings <breath> that are here <breath> some things i don't like about london <disfl.uh> are the fact that it's so overcrowded seems that everywhere you go there are people every time of the day 24 hours seven days a week <breath> sometimes you just can't escape the fact that there are so many people around <breath> there's a lot of traffic in london and a lot of people using public transport <breath> you feel like you're fighting for space all the time <breath> i do have a favorite restaurant <breath> and it serves english cuisine but the inside of the restaurant is decorated in old church furniture <breath> it's based in kilburn in north london <breath> and you may be sitting on an old pew from a church while you're eating <breath> <disfl.um> being served wine from a chalice or you may be sitting staring at a pulpit with no minister in it <breath> the food is very good and it's not very expensive it's always quite a busy place <breath> i have been to all the parks in london but i think my favorite park is hyde park <breath> i like the fact that it has a lake <breath> and you can actually take a boat onto the lake and roll around in the summertime <breath> it also has a really nice cafe called the serpentine <breath> which is on the edge of the lake and you can sit outside all times of year have a coffee <breath> and watch the swans on the ducks gliding past <breath> it's always <disfl.uh> popular with tourists <breath> and hyde park is one of the royal parks in london of which there are five <breath> but i particularly like it because it's right bang in the center but you also feel like you're not in london when you're walking around it <breath> it has got a <breath> very interesting italian garden <breath> on the north side near <breath> gloucester <disfl.uh> place <breath> <disfl.um> which was designed in the early 19th century it has a pagoda and some fountains <breath> which make it a really nice place to chill out <breath> some of the other places in hyde park which are quite interesting are the peter pan statue <breath> and also speaker's corner where <breath> an ancient law allows people to stand up <breath> and say things even which are offensive nowadays but without getting arrested so it has the only place in london left where you have freedom of speech <breath> and you can discuss any subject <breath> you want without being arrested <breath> if i met someone new in the city what would i recommend they go and see <breath> i think probably my favorite landmark in london is tower bridge <breath> i'm always in awe of the size of its structure <breath> and the fact that it is a bridge that actually opens up <breath> <disfl.uh> to allow boats and ships to go through the center of it <breath> i've often marveled at the engineering and the fact that it was 250 built over years ago <breath> shows <disfl.uh> that the people that were around then are obviously very intelligent and they built something that really has lasted the test of time <breath> <disfl.um> the area around tower bridge is also very interesting because it used to be <breath> the old docks of london where all the ships the spices came in from <breath> the west india trading company <breath> some <disfl.uh> of the buildings you can still smell the spices
