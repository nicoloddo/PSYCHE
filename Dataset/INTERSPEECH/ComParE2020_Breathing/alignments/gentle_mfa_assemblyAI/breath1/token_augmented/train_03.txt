<disfl.uh> so i moved to london in 2010 when i started university at ucl <breath> so first i studied speech and language therapy and i did the undergraduate program which <disfl.uh> was four years so before that i lived in working which isn't too far away from <disfl.uh> london anyway <breath> <breath> <disfl.um> but after that i moved away from london for <disfl.um> another two years and move back home to woking <breath> and then move back again well <disfl.um> about three years ago <breath> <disfl.um> back to chisel so now i live in <disfl.um> london full time <breath> <breath> so <disfl.uh> some things i like about london <disfl.um> i love that you can kind of <breath> do anything you want anytime you want <disfl.um> so there's never a boring weekend there's always something more to go and see or to go and look at or that you haven't visited before even if you're revisiting things that <disfl.ah> you really like <breath> i also love that it's really easy <disfl.um> to get around town so there's loads of ways to travel <breath> <disfl.um> on the overground and underground and on the buses so it's really easy to get out and about <breath> the <disfl.uh> other thing i love is that <disfl.um> they have lots of <disfl.ah> vegan options in london so <disfl.um> i became vegan in january this year <breath> and i found that there's so many options <disfl.um> available in and around london <breath> but these kind of reduce quite a lot when you go out of london so it's really great that all these they have <disfl.um> options available on <disfl.uh> your doorstep <breath> <disfl.um> some things i don't like about london i hate my commute so <disfl.uh> i have to commute in from west london every day <disfl.um> and it takes me about an hour each way <breath> and it's definitely the worst part of my day <disfl.um> i hate having to go home in the dark in the evening <breath> on the tube and then walk another 10 minutes in the rain <breath> i'd love to live a bit closer but i can't <disfl.uh> what else did i like about london <disfl.um> it's really busy all of the time <disfl.um> you can't stand still anywhere because there's always someone <breath> trying to get past you <disfl.um> but i also really like that aspect of london that it is busy and there's always a good atmosphere wherever you go <breath> <breath> <breath> <disfl.um> i don't really have a favorite restaurant in london <disfl.um> tend to eat in quite a few different places don't tend to go back to the same place <disfl.um> but like i said i'm vegan so always looking for new places to try <breath> <disfl.um> but i typically tend to be in east london which is kind of annoying because i live in west london so it's a little bit of a track there <disfl.ah> to go and visit <disfl.uh> a few of those places <breath> <breath> if <disfl.uh> i met someone new in the city i'd probably recommend <disfl.um> that they go and visit all the different <disfl.um> kind of little suburbs in london so kind of north london is obviously really different from <disfl.um> south and east london <breath> and they all got their own character and their all own <disfl.um> vibe going on so it would be <breath> kind of <disfl.um> amiss if you didn't go and see all of those different areas to get a real feel for the city and <disfl.um> i say get out of central london <disfl.um> get out of all the tourist traps and just go and see where people live <breath> <disfl.um> and go and see some of the smaller areas and have a little wander around and you'll always find something <breath> interesting to do <breath> <disfl.um> i haven't actually been to that many of the tourist attractions <disfl.um> i think i've been on the london eye about ten years ago <breath> and <disfl.um> went to the london dungeons otherwise tend to try and avoid them because they're always very busy and very expensive <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> london i was good maybe a little overrated maybe a little overpriced but it is an icon and so i can see why people would want to come here and have a go on it <disfl.um> what else shall i talk about <disfl.um> have i been to any of the parks in london <disfl.um> yeah i used to live <disfl.um> on gower street so my local park used to be reading
