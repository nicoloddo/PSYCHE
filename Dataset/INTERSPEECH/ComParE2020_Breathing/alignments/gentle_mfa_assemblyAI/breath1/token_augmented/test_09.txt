i came to london for work largely by necessity because of a lack of interesting opportunities <breath> in ireland which is where i was born and raised <breath> i <breath> have <breath> like certain things about london certain things i don't like i like the variety i like the interesting people that i get to meet <breath> i think that there is lots of art here there are lots of lots <disfl.um> <breath> cultural activities that at various stages during my time in london <breath> i have participated in i have liked <breath> <disfl.um> i guess there are also lots of people like me here so i feel reasonably comfortable with that <breath> in a way that i don't think is possible for me <breath> back in ireland at this stage of my life <breath> the things that i don't like in london have probably evolved in my time here <breath> and <breath> part of it is that i think london has become far more overcrowded in the last <breath> 15 20 to years that i remember it being <breath> i think that also has an effect on people's behavior i think people are a lot less <breath> well mannered <breath> in public people walking on the street seem to be quite happy to <breath> bump into people there's an expectation that <breath> everybody should get out of their way <breath> so for example i was in primrose hill a few years ago <breath> a woman decided that she should run backwards down the hill <breath> and was quite offended that i called her on this she seemed to think that everybody else should actually get out of her way <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> london has become a very dirty city <breath> people just seem entitled to just chuck their <breath> litter anywhere that they go <breath> people leaving their coffee cups sitting on top of a <breath> piece of equipment in the middle of the street <breath> equally i find that all these free bikes <disfl.um> for rent bikes are just parked in the middle of the pavement so for me walking along the street <breath> i'm supposed to get out of their way why because an american corporation wants to make money <breath> and because a lot of people think that <breath> the world revolves around them <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> do i have a favorite restaurant in london favorite food <breath> i've been fortunate over my career to have <breath> had years living on <breath> a business expense account where i could go and eat in very good restaurants <breath> as a result of that my preference these days is for informal places where i can chill out <breath> where i can relax <breath> and where i don't have to <breath> conform in certain ways <breath> so for me currently living around made a veil there are places like the elgin which have got <breath> good healthy food but it's not foodie food <breath> it is reasonably priced <breath> <disfl.um> the staff are friendly and a key part of the experience is the atmosphere <breath> <breath> the other thing i guess i like that is still hillary here in london is sushi for me i'm a yo sushi fan <breath> the idea that i can actually walk in and get this stuff reasonably priced <breath> is very appealing <breath> parks in london do i have a favorite i <breath> <disfl.um> live quite close to regents park for many years <breath> and i have played tennis there for about the last 15 years <breath> so i have a connection with that <breath> i'm currently walking looking after a friend's dog for the vacation <breath> as a result of which i've been taking this dog both for regents park and to paddington recreation ground <breath> yeah there's lots of good things in them <disfl.um> lots of space to walk around <breath> quite enjoyable <breath> <breath> recommendations on <breath> the city for somebody coming here for the first time <breath> i think the first question is what does that person like what is interest to them <breath> the old parts of london are attractive to some people <breath> and not to others they are also
