what brings you to london <disfl.um> i moved here to <breath> start an empress program at ucl <disfl.uh> i was previously <breath> in new york so that was <breath> kind of a tough decision to leave the united states but i did want to get out of the united states for sure <breath> <disfl.uh> m but i could have stayed i guess in new york my job for one more year <breath> maybe <breath> see where that led <breath> but <disfl.uh> that's what brings me here so i guess exploration but also mainly school <breath> <disfl.um> what are some things i like about london i <breath> like the program i like the relatively calmer pace of life compared to <breath> my situation in new york for sure i like that i'm not commuting 2 hours a day on the train <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i like the apartment better for sure <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> what are some things you do not like about i don't like that it rains every day <disfl.uh> a lot of days i also don't currently like the winter because it's dark out a lot <breath> i wish there was more sun and more hours in the daylight <breath> <disfl.um> yeah <breath> do <breath> <disfl.uh> you have a favorite restaurant and cuisine so i love mexican food i also love <disfl.uh> vietnamese food <breath> so they have chipotle here that's like my favorite restaurant in the states but it's a little different it's not worse or better but <breath> <disfl.um> it's different i've gotten it a few times but i've been trying to eat more well i need to save money because i don't have as much so i've been eating more at home cooking meals i do feel like some of the food here is <breath> better <disfl.uh> quality though compared to maybe the preservatives they put in a lot of food in the states i don't know maybe that's the thing here i just noticed that <breath> <disfl.um> but interestingly i've had only vietnamese <disfl.ah> one time since i've moved here <breath> and i would get it like multiple times a week in new york <breath> <disfl.um> well i think it's interesting because there's a <breath> vietnamese place right across the street from me i still have not been there <breath> <disfl.uh> okay next question <breath> have you been to any of the parks i just went to hyde park <breath> this past weekend which was very very nice <disfl.um> <breath> i really like me and my fiance went and she loves nature and the animals <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> it was very nice seeing like going by the pond i really like that part <breath> and seeing all the geese and the swans is the huge swan <breath> and how they're just not really afraid of humans here it's a nice symbiotic relationship they have where <breath> they get fed can it's approach humans and take pictures and <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> really cool but <disfl.uh> as far as the park i've been to <breath> that park i've been to one other park i <disfl.um> <breath> can't remember the name this is just generally i need to do more exploring of the city though i feel like <breath> during the semester i focused a lot on work and now i've been off and i've had somewhat of a break and i haven't really done exploring i don't know when i will but <breath> i should be taking more advantage of that <breath> if <disfl.um> you met someone new to the city <breath> what would you recommend they go to see or do <breath> i probably wouldn't be the best tour guide at this point i <disfl.um> <breath> would just say i really like the area around piccadilly circus <disfl.uh> <breath> it's probably pretty touristy but you could even just walk around there for a few hours there's a lot to see lot to do <breath> depending whatever food you like you <disfl.um> <breath> can definitely find it in that area <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> okay i know i got to kill him but i want to go back up to what i don't like
