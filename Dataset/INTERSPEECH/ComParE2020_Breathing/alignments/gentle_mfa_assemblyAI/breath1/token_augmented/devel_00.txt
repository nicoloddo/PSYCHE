so <disfl.um> my name is jamel and i've lived in london my whole life <breath> my favorite thing about london are the museums and all of the <breath> <disfl.um> community centers and all the activities that you can do around there all the pubs and the clubs i guess <disfl.uh> my favorite area would be <breath> south kensington <breath> <disfl.um> around there at night's bridge they have lots of <breath> of <breath> nice <disfl.um> european food <disfl.um> <breath> they have a taco bell there are things that you don't really get in other places in london <breath> i guess compared to where i live <breath> <disfl.um> there's nicer parks as well <breath> <disfl.um> you have the bikes in london which there isn't <breath> much in those rural areas as well but there are starting to be <breath> built out and i guess my favorite restaurant used <breath> <disfl.um> nando's to be but it's now more <disfl.um> <breath> i do like a buffet that there is quite near my neighborhood so they serve lots of different types of food so they serve pizza <breath> and <breath> my favorite food would be <breath> <disfl.um> indian food to be honest like curry so it would be the curry and the chicken lamb <breath> and the different types of rice and <breath> spices that they have which <breath> i do know some of the names and so they have potatoes and stuff and stuff like that as well so they have pompedoms <breath> which is something nice nothing nice which gods of <breath> the indian being my favorite food <breath> and yeah but i guess in london there isn't really too many indian places that <breath> i <disfl.um> would go to <breath> to eat <breath> and so <disfl.um> my favorite places would be close to my home <breath> in that regard and <disfl.um> i guess i went to university <breath> in london and so while i was there i was imperial in south kensington so <breath> that's another reason why south is a favorite area <breath> of mine and then we have the <disfl.um> <breath> i was doing <disfl.um> <breath> medicine so when i was studying medicine <breath> i <disfl.um> only done basically the first year <breath> and so now i decided to work still in london <breath> but <disfl.um> i was always interested in doing research <breath> i was interested in research like becoming a <breath> therapist a psychiatrist <breath> but i guess i was always thinking that <breath> <disfl.uh> i wasn't really into the surgical aspects of medicine and so we obviously had to do <breath> every everything we were learning the course but i wasn't really into cutting the bodies and doing <breath> some of that stuff so i thought i can find a different path <breath> and i have felt like <disfl.um> <breath> it'd be easy for me to start working now and maybe go back to university <breath> later on <breath> and so <breath> i might go to improve there's lots of <disfl.um> different courses <breath> that do offer similar things i guess i would still want to stay in london if i go to university <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.um> i guess <breath> <breath> the idea of going to a place outside of london to like a more rural area <breath> wouldn't be too <breath> enticing for me because i guess i had most <disfl.um> <breath> of my school and earlier on <breath> done in a more rural setting <breath> than <disfl.um> london would be and obviously i like the fact that it's near <breath> lots of <disfl.um> different places <breath> <disfl.uh> different types of restaurants and stuff like that and i <disfl.um> <breath> guess in london the best things <breath> usually are kind of just like in the center <breath> to where they have all the different museums like in lechester square <breath> i'd recommend <disfl.um> people to go to <breath> maybe the science museums and like the art museums
