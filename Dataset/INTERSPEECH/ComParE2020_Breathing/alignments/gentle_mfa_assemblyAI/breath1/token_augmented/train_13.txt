okay so what brings me to london well <disfl.uh> i've lived here for pretty much all my life <breath> <disfl.uh> i was born in japan but i came here when i was four years old so <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah i don't know what brought me to london but i've been here all my life and <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> london is great i've i'm a i'm a big city boy i guess i've tried living <breath> well i mean i had to live <disfl.uh> in a smaller <breath> city <disfl.uh> oxford for my undergrad and that was <breath> a bit boring because there's not too much to do <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i think also coming from an asian community there's a bit more of like a <breath> japanese scene in london <disfl.um> so you have a bit more things to do <breath> <disfl.uh> with your japanese friends in london <breath> <disfl.um> what else do i like about london <breath> i like that there are <breath> many people <breath> i think i feel most comfortable when there's <breath> loads of people about <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> for example when you're just walking through soho or things like that in the evening <breath> you see loads of people having fun there's logging around you a lot of lights and stuff <breath> yeah it's different from oxford for example doing the same in oxford <breath> just feels a bit smaller <breath> you don't feel <breath> as part of a big crowd or a big place <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah <breath> things i don't like about london <breath> that <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> is actually very hard to think about things i didn't like about london at the moment <breath> i guess things are expensive <breath> i mean that's a pretty bad thing i guess <breath> and other things it's far from <disfl.uh> my <breath> home country which is japan it's expensive to go to japan and <breath> <breath> <disfl.uh> it takes a long time there's like a big <breath> time <disfl.uh> lag <breath> so it's hard to call family and so on <breath> but generally yeah i've been to a few places and i don't know if it's just because it's home but <breath> there's not too many things i don't like about london <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah <breath> do i have <breath> <disfl.uh> so my favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath> favorite restaurant don't is a difficult question i like being asked what is my favorite of anything <breath> same about cuisine but <breath> just to answer your question i'll give you a nice restaurant that i know of <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and that is one called ginz in chinatown they do a really good hot pot <breath> m hot pot is a great place to go with your friends it can be just one person that can be like ten people <breath> <disfl.um> you can eat what you want to at the pace that you want <breath> and <breath> if you're feeling really up for a good time you can go for karaoke as well <breath> they have like <breath> private rooms and <breath> places where you can go and chill and sing with your friends <breath> <breath> favorite cuisine recently i've been enjoying <breath> thai i guess <breath> which is a little bit <breath> strange because i'm also trying to go on a <breath> spiceless diet <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah but <breath> maybe it's a bit of a guilty pleasure it's always fun to have a lot of spice in your food <breath> my favorite park <breath> i think must be hyde park i guess i live near there so i have a strong bias but <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> one of the nice things about hyde park is that the run <breath> around the serpentine which is the lake inside
