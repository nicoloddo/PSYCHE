<disfl.um> what brings me to london well i live in london so <disfl.um> i have lived in london for most of my life it's most probably the favourite my most favorite place in the world even though i have traveled <breath> been to other places but <breath> it's always london that <disfl.uh> calls you back <breath> <disfl.um> what are some of the things i like about london well <breath> i like that it's so <breath> varied there's so many different things to do in london so many different types of people <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.uh> yeah <breath> what are some of the things i don't like about london <breath> well it rains a lot it's <disfl.um> quite cold <breath> <disfl.um> it can get quite busy there's a lot of people around <breath> <disfl.um> it's one of the major cities of the world so there's obviously lots of tourism <breath> that's attracted to london which is not necessarily a bad thing but <disfl.um> <breath> i think when you're <breath> a londoner and you're just trying to <breath> get around it can be quite difficult <breath> especially <disfl.uh> in the holiday seasons <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> do i have favorite a <breath> restaurant i have a favorite don't restaurant really <breath> <disfl.um> but my <breath> favorite type of cuisine <breath> is probably turkish food or anything that's like grilled meat <breath> <disfl.um> so yeah it's kind of like middle eastern but mediterranean style food <breath> <disfl.um> it's very widely available in london <breath> <disfl.um> particularly in certain areas of central london like eduar road or <breath> places like that or <breath> <breath> knightsbridge <disfl.um> turkish food is very tasty it's making me hungry right now even thinking about it <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> have i been to any parks in london do i have a favorite park <breath> <disfl.um> i have been to pretty much most of the parks in london <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.ah> don't really have a favorite one but if i had to pick i would say <breath> regents park because it's in a really good location <breath> <disfl.um> having said that so is hyde park <breath> they're <disfl.uh> both in really good locations depending on what <breath> other things you want to do <breath> other than just going to a park <disfl.um> and within the parks obviously there's <breath> sort of activities that you can do like boat riding <breath> <disfl.um> et cetera and stuff like that so <disfl.uh> it's pretty cool <breath> it's quite fun <breath> especially on a summer's day <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if i met someone new to the city what would i recommend they go and see <breath> this is a good one <disfl.um> i think one of the things i really enjoy doing in london <breath> <disfl.uh> even though i might have done it more than once <disfl.um> is visiting the museums <breath> in south kensington <breath> and i would really recommend if somebody was new to the city <breath> <disfl.um> to go and visit <disfl.uh> like the natural history museum and victoria and albert museum <breath> <disfl.um> i just think there's so much to see <breath> and so much to learn and <breath> when you're kind of a londoner from birth pretty much and you have schooled in london you've visited these museums as a child but as an adult there's just so much more value to actually going there and <breath> taking it all in <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> the last question have you been to any tourist attractions for example the london eye did you enjoy it was overheated <disfl.um> i've been a tourist in my own town
