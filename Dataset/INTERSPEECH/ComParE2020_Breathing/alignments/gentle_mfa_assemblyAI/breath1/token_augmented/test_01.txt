<disfl.um> so i've come to london <disfl.uh> for multiple reasons <breath> firstly i got married in september and my now husband works <breath> <disfl.uh> in here london so i moved here to join him here <breath> <disfl.um> but also i got a job <disfl.um> here at ucl <breath> <disfl.um> to postdoc work as a <disfl.um> which was lucky <breath> given my husband was here so that was good <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> london is quite different i was in oxford before which <breath> <disfl.um> is a m much smaller city and <breath> i find london quite <disfl.um> busy and <breath> quite overwhelming <disfl.um> but we live quite far out <disfl.um> for michael winchmore hill which <breath> i've heard described as <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> just <breath> really not very <breath> like london <disfl.um> given it is in london it's very quiet and feels quite suburban and we have a village green and <breath> it's quite nice so <disfl.um> <breath> i actually like being able to escape the center and <breath> travel back out to the quiet suburbs <breath> that come in for work <disfl.um> and have the option to come in and <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> have all the attractions of london close by but <disfl.um> <breath> not too close <disfl.um> we did think about moving further in so that my commute would be better <breath> but we decided we just liked it <disfl.um> further out where it was a bit quieter <breath> and like to me it isn't too bad <disfl.um> <breath> it's 35 minutes door to door which is <breath> pretty good for london so <disfl.um> i feel like we kind of have the best of both worlds in that way <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but there are there are lots of things i like about london too <breath> there are a lot of concerts here <disfl.um> <breath> which is nice we didn't have so many back in oxford so <breath> it's cool to get to see bands i like much <disfl.uh> more easily <breath> <disfl.um> and the food as well <disfl.um> <breath> me and my husband quite like going to restaurants particularly he likes quite posh places so <breath> when his <disfl.uh> mum comes to visit we quite often go somewhere nice in london because she really likes her good food too <breath> <disfl.um> so yeah we've been to quite a range of different places <breath> <disfl.um> around where we are there's a lot of italian restaurants not quite sure why i think there's quite a <breath> big italian community <disfl.um> <breath> which is probably my favorite type of food so that's quite nice <breath> <disfl.um> so yeah we enjoy going out for food quite a lot <breath> <disfl.um> and the parks in london are cool too <disfl.um> we have quite a few round <breath> where we are but i like the fact that even in the center <breath> you have these quite big <breath> <disfl.um> open spaces that you can go to <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i really like hyde park for example that's really nice but <breath> most of them are pretty nice <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so i definitely recommend those to people coming <breath> to london for the first time i think the parks are one of the best things about london <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> there's all sorts something i would <breath> probably <breath> recommend if someone was new to the city <breath> <disfl.um> would be something called the wallace collection which is <breath> kind of like this old house where <breath> six centric old man used to live i think maybe he was an architect or <breath> something but he collected a lot of different things a lot of <breath> random bizarre things and they're all in this house <breath> <disfl.um> and it's just a really interesting collection of objects and <breath> old bits of old buildings kind of all thrown in together and that was quite cool <disfl.um> i'm not sure many people know about that so that's probably what i would <breath> recommend to someone <disfl.uh> to go to if they <breath> were new to london <disfl.um> <breath> but i haven't really been to many of the other <breath> sort of big tourist attractions like the london i <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> don't know <breath> i think they're just often so busy <breath> <disfl.um> and full of people that i tend to steer clear <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> probably more i've been to <breath> tourist attractions in terms of shopping
