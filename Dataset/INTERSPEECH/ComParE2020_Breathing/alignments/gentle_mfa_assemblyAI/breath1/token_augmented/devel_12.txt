i moved to london in 2017 to start my masters at ucl at the institute of cognitive neuroscience <breath> in cognitive neuroscience <breath> so i did that for a year <breath> and then i was applying for master's degrees for a second year as part of the same program that brought me here <breath> but i decided instead to start my phd <breath> so i started my phd at the icn as well in 2018 and i'm doing that now <breath> i really love living in london it's completely different than where i'm used to i grew up in a very rural part of vermont in the us so i'm <breath> very much not used to the city <breath> but i really like all the green space that london has i find that other cities i've been to like new york city <breath> and washington dc just don't have quite enough green for me and feel very overwhelming because of tall buildings and very corporate feel <breath> but i really like that london has lots of trees and parks and generally buildings that are not so high <breath> and i also love all of the free museums that's probably one of my favorite things about living here you don't have to spend <breath> loads of money although it's easy to do that too while going out and about in london <breath> some things that i do not like about london are the air quality again <disfl.uh> being from a very rural part of the us i'm used to much different smelling and tasting air than in london <breath> <disfl.um> i don't love that it doesn't get snow although i guess sometimes i do like that it's easier to commute <breath> <disfl.um> in london than in vermont because you don't have to scrape off your car full of ice and wade through sometimes like 5ft of snow to get to work <breath> or <disfl.uh> even just to get to your car <breath> but i don't love the cold rain that you get especially this month in january when it's like big heavy wet cold rain i don't like that <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i don't like that it gets dark really early that's something i didn't expect when i moved here <breath> i thought being from really far north in the us would mean that i would be used to hours of daylight being relatively short <breath> but actually i think daylight hours in <breath> january at least are about 1 hour longer in vermont <breath> than in london so i struggle sometimes with the early sunsets <breath> and my other least favorite thing about london is probably <breath> the tube although <breath> i actually really appreciate having effective public transportation so i guess that's also something i like and don't like <breath> <disfl.um> my favorite restaurant in london is this place called <disfl.um> <breath> no i can't remember life goddess <disfl.um> it's a greek restaurant on store street and it's delicious in <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> general i love greek food and turkish food and my other favorite restaurant in london is a place called the pitted olive which is on lee street not far away from the icn <breath> my favorite park in london is richmond park <breath> i'm not actually sure that that's yeah no it is in london <breath> <disfl.um> i love that you can see all of the deer running around and it's really fun to cycle around the whole park <disfl.uh> although it's very challenging i learned when i went for the first time there's a massive hill right before you get to the fun part <breath> <disfl.um> but i really love richmond park i also love hyde park <disfl.um> and regents park <breath> and the canal at regents park too <breath> if i met someone new to the city i would tell them to definitely check out borough market which is a very <breath> <breath> traditional <disfl.uh> thing to say but it's probably <breath> the best thing i have ever experienced in my life <breath> we get the best olive oil and cheese from borough market and i always tell people to go there not necessarily to buy pre made food but to buy ingredients to make food because i think they have wonderful ingredients <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i also would suggest that i always
