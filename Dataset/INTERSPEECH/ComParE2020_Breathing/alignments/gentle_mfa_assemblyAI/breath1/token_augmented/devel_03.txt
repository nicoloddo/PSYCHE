<disfl.uh> so i come from singapore and i came over to london to pursue my undergraduate studies <breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> before <breath> <disfl.uh> i lived even though i'm singapore and i've also lived in china and south korea <breath> and before i came over to london <breath> i <disfl.um> studied psychology and angered science and i'm currently in my third year <breath> <disfl.um> so upon graduation i hope to pursue msc in <breath> developmental psychology either at ucl or at kings <breath> and i hope to be a <disfl.uh> developmental or child psychologist <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so some of my hobbies include <breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> running as well as traveling <disfl.uh> i recently came back from germany and japan i <breath> <disfl.uh> have some family in japan so i go to japan almost every at <breath> least once a <breath> <breath> year <disfl.um> the favorite <disfl.um> country that i've been to so far <breath> i would say or rather the favorite city <breath> that i like <disfl.ah> thus far i think it was to be like tokyo <breath> because i like how <breath> efficient it is i like how <breath> transport <disfl.uh> there is so much more convenient and i like how everything opens <breath> <disfl.uh> until really late at night <breath> and so i can still <breath> get food <breath> when i hang out with my friends really late <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah <disfl.uh> some of the other countries that i really enjoyed visiting includes <breath> greece <breath> mauritius <breath> <disfl.um> melbourne <breath> which is part <breath> of australia <breath> and <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> bali in indonesia <breath> i think that's because i really like <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> the beach and i really like the sea <breath> and i really like to go south boarding <breath> so that's why i guess i really like <disfl.um> countries with <breath> beaches and <disfl.um> the seaside in general <breath> i <disfl.uh> hope to stay in london <breath> for another <breath> two years <breath> and <breath> potentially <disfl.um> <breath> move <breath> to canada <breath> or back to south korea where i once lived <breath> <disfl.uh> i want to move to canada to canada because i really like <breath> cold winters and i really like the snow <breath> and i just like being around nature <breath> so <breath> <disfl.uh> that is one of m one of the big reasons why i want to move there <breath> <disfl.uh> i think london might get a bit too busy for me sometimes <breath> so and there's <breath> a lot of people so that's why i might not <breath> generally <disfl.uh> want to live here in the long term <breath> <disfl.uh> south korea is also another option for me because <disfl.uh> i lived there for really long and <breath> <disfl.uh> a lot of my friends are there <breath> <breath> <disfl.uh> and i think i'm also really used to the country so that's also another reason why <breath> i think i might want to move back to south korea after <breath> living in london <breath> <disfl.uh> but with that said i really like london a lot i like how diverse this i like how i can meet so many different people here coming from so many different backgrounds <breath> and i like how it's also really close to europe i think if i had not come to london to pursue my undergraduate studies i don't think i would have
