So what brings you to London <breath> um <breath> I came to London to go to university and study psychology and language sciences at ucl <breath> um but after about a term I realized this course wasn't really for me So actually I'm dropping out and I'm going to change course <breath> I'm hoping to study fine art at ucl again in September 2020 <breath> Some of the things I like about London are <breath> uh how multicultured it is <breath> and <breath> how big it is <breath> and how busy it is all the time <breath> because I came from a very small town in Wales called monmouth <breath> and it's very different from here <breath> Some of the things I do not like about London is probably <breath> the pollution <breath> and how loud it is every night <breath> because <breath> I'm not used to that and I <breath> fall asleep very lightly and I wake up very easily <breath> and the accommodation is so hot that I have to open the window every night <breath> And every night without fail I hear ambulances and police sirens <breath> and it's just very sad <breath> <breath> Favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath> um <breath> I would say my favorite <breath> cuisine is probably Asian because it's very homely to me <breath> and my family always used to cook food from Hong Kong The <breath> favorite dish made from Obergin I don't know the English translation but it tastes very very good <breath> even though it smells a bit funky Favorite <breath> um <breath> restaurant At the moment <breath> I don't really have a favorite restaurant but I did hear that Roti King <breath> near Houston Station is very good <breath> so I'll probably go visit that soon for some roti <breath> as well as for the atmosphere M <breath> <breath> I like Japanese food but <breath> a lot of the more budget end sushi is not that great here <breath> which is kind of sad <breath> But I do enjoy making sushi with my flatmates <breath> um that's quite entertaining even if we can't roll it out properly most of the time <breath> And it doesn't always taste great because most of them are vegan and <breath> we can't put a fish in it or anything <breath> Have I been to any of the parks in London Do I have a favorite park <breath> M <breath> I went to hyde Park <breath> with my course mate last term which is very fun <breath> We walked there from our accommodation which was probably about <breath> a ah 35 minutes to 40 minutes walk <breath> which is not that bad but it's quite some exercise And then we had to walk further into hyde Park to get to surf uh the serpentine I <breath> think that's the lake there <breath> It was a really chill day because it was autumn and all the leaves were starting to come down and it was quite pretty <breath> um <breath> oh I heard that uh <breath> no wait Yeah I went to Winter wonderland which I know was in hyde Park That was also very fun <breath> It was greater than I imagined and the food marketplace is very exciting and festive even though I do think that winters <breath> and Christmas is quite overrated sometimes <breath> It was nice to go there with my friends and then my family <breath> for New Years <breath> <breath> Another M thing that <breath> I noted about the park in Winter wonderland <breath> was that the rides were quite expensive which is very sad because I wanted to ride all of them <breath> but they were way too expensive and out of budget for me as a student <breath> <breath> um <breath> if you met someone new to the city what would you recommend they go see or do <breath> um I probably recommend
