cool so i came to london uh um for a job i'm at e c l um i was very happy my last job uh and this one came up just at the right time and it's worth made sense because um my partner is done here my family live close to london um so it's all seen like the right time uh to finally bite the bullet and move um which is very exciting i like the fact that there's lots of things to do in london that's lots of um uh culture source of music uh are free out to go to loss of uh uh museums you'll never stuck for things to do i like the fact that there's things i'll always open as well i'm not everything shuts at five uh clock like at my home town and uh that's good but i thought things that don't like that london i don't like the fact that it's um uh uh uh uh uh uh uh so busy um is so expensive that was a really big shock after coming back uh living in uh uh um biominging for so long and that everything is probably like double the price and you can pay eight pounds for point which is ludicrous um i try and avoid the tubes uh during russia because it's so busy as well and when i do have to take the chief that's pretty pretty horrendous and um people on this friendly as when you're out of the sticks because there's people everywhere whereas you might not see people for ages uh uh miles if you go out for a walk out in the countryside because that's a bit uh annoying um i love the fact that i live um up in north london in quiet turkish area so there is a really good turkish uh restaurant which is one of the good things about london as well i have noticed so uh multi cultural so that means that there's lots of lots of uh good food and their restaurants are really cheap where i live as well um so that's pretty good but you have to be careful because of ways it can be quite expensive if you go uh to the wrong places and central which is a bit annoying and there's uh lots of parks near uh me as wow so uh finishery park is not that uh far away from me um which is quite convenient but you see some strange things there i saw someone uh practicing their drum just on the grouth when i was walking home once and probably uh didn't wanna cause too much noise and to start the house mates so far enough but probably not your usual instrument of choice um i've also been to high park as well and i don't go there uh that often and there's a uh few sort of more local parks near where i am where they put on quite a few events as well so that's nice um so if someone was new to the city i would suggest that they go to the welcome trust because there's all sorts of weird medical stuff there um which is really good uh um the tape modern's always good all uh day something lots a bit weird depending on what sort of things you like i worried uh um i haven't seen many of the tourists attractions um despite the fact that i used to grow up fairly near london and i live there now so i've never been to london i um i'm not really sure what the big fusses about and i don't know if i level really uh pay that much to go up there uh uh uh i've never already done the london dungeons or
