well i'm in london because primarily that's where my work is i e and working at the uh uclear institute which is on grave in road near uh king's cross and but i i've lived in london previously as well so they uh used to work in finance and i moved here for the uh first time in two thousand and one after finishing university i live mostly in around south london so was initially in uh east college then in the clap um and then in kennington so uh uh at the moment i'm living in oxford and i'm down in london usually three or four days a week mostly just coming down into paddington or into malibun and getting the cheaper cross to king's cross um but uh i do the uh various groups of friends here who i don't see as often as i would like to um but when i do then i'll i'll uh tend to go down to uh central london or over to um victoria where quite a few of my friends work or maybe go and stay with friends in cannington when i'm at in london though um i've got i've got four memories of london as well from from those previous times and my brother used to live in east london and quite a few of his friends are still um in that area so i see them um fairly often and uh quite often end up going to concerts in london sometimes with my uh my dad who's also uh interested in music and sings and so we'll go to chamber music uh concerts for example some of the things i like about london are the fact that it's it's got this very rich history uh and the signs of that all over the uh place there are different levels of of london um being built on top of one another so there are glimpses of those those lower levels or those earlier levels if you look hard enough and uh i do like the the cosmopolitan nature of the city the diversity of the people here the different languages you can hear spoken and the different cuisines that you can find and um the fact that there's always uh somewhere new to explore so they'll always be a whether it's a museum or another restaurant or another neighbourhood uh um i also like to just get on a bus and sit at the front at the top and look above the shop front level and look at the roofs of the buildings um which again can uh reveal some of the londons history things i don't like so much about london include um the rickety nature of some of the infrastructure the heat on the underground um and although i uh engage in this behaviour myself the fact that it is sometimes quite isolated people do their own thing you get on the tube and there's not much i contact i don't really notice it too much when i'm in london but when i'm away from london i'm more aware of what london misses from that perspective um other things i don't like about london i'm um gonna move on to the next question actually so do i have a favorite restaurant or cuisine and is it available in london i i don't uh think i have a particular favorite i uh uh do enjoy chinese food having lived in china for a while and i there's uh uh plenty of chinese food here in london um whether you were in chinatown so ho area or elsewhere i've got fun memories of a greek uh cypriot restaurant in katherine um north which had wonderful meza uh uh and great bread that they used to make there and that also um i enjoy that because it reminds me of times uh when i've been in greece uh for example in cretor and i was also had had a good holiday in the salamic have i been to any of the parks here in london while i yeart have uh been to several of them i don't spend as much time in the the big central ones like high park green park and since james's park but there are some nice
