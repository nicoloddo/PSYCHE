i have lived in london since i was born i've lived in um my whole life and so i'm um i'm a little bit sort of blaze about it i guess um i don't see as many benefits as some people do but i do still like the city um some things that i like most about london is the uh the people so i think the the range of people in london is um really unique and i love am going to know people from different places and with different experiences and things um something else i like about london a lot is that um there's always something going on so you can always find something to do if you want to umm and there's uh kind of unique stuff that doesn't happen so much in other places like you know there's always uh some new kind of shop opening or a new kind of event happening or something like that um but there's a uh few things i don't like about london so i think my lease favorite thing is there's no there's not uh much green space um so i definitely like to be are in london but just with more greenery and more uh nature um that's my lease favorite thing but i also don't like how um it's so busy that sometimes people uh don't take the time to talk to each other or even notice each other and um they just sort of go about their business every day um so i would say that i'm overall i really like london but it definitely has its ups and downs um and if i if i move out of uh london i'd like to go somewhere uh with a sort uh of more more of a small community feel and definitely like more access to nature like mountains or forests lakes or stuff like that um so my favourite cuisine is um like japanese food does quite a lot of it available in london um but i i have like a a favour at restaurant as well um it's probably tokyo diner which is no less the square um and it does really really nice vegetarian japanese food um so i've uh i'm vegetarian as well and it's uh sometimes quite difficult to find japanese food without fish um or pork so yeah i really appreciate that they um they do really good like food with um tofu or with other sort of vegetarian substitutes um that don't have metal fish and uh my favorite food that they do there is the toffee cats you curry uhm i have been to a lot of parks in london but i definitely want to explore them more so my favourite is probably hampson heath just because it's so big and there are so many dogs there i really like dogs umm so yeah my favorite is probably hampson heath but i haven't actually been to richmond park which is kind of crazy because i've lived here all my life but yeah uh i kind of always feel like i will do it one day but just never sort of get round to it because i just i know it's sort of not gonna go anywhere um so i definitely want to do that um same dangers park is also really nice i like the the water there and the birds and stuff like that um that's something i really like about london as well even though it's um an urban environment there's a lot of birds uh and in the morning you can hear bird sole and things switch is very nice um if i met someone that was new to the city i would definitely recommend they go to the heath in fact whenever someone's visiting i always recommend they go there because um quite few people visit london but don't know about the heath ant answered heath so yeah i think it's really nice and there's so uh much of it to
