Cool. So I came to London UM, for a job UM, at ucl. UM I wasn't very happy in my last job, UM, and this one came up just at the right time and it sort of made sense because UM, my partners down here and my family live close to London. UM, so it sort of seemed like the right time to uh finally bite the bullet and move UM, which is very exciting. UM I like the fact that there's lots of things to do in London, UM, there's lots of culture, there's lots of music, uh, art, ah, free art to go to, lots of museums, you're never stuck for things to do. I like the fact that UM, there's things that are always open as well. Not everything shuts at 05:00 like at my hometown. UM, and that's good. UM, but there's lots of things I don't like about London. I don't like the fact that it's so busy, UM, it's so expensive. That was a really big shock after coming back, uh, living in Birmingham for so long UM, that everything is probably like double the price and you can pay £8 for a pint which is ludicrous. UM, I try and avoid the tubes during rush hour because it's so busy as well. UM and when I do have to take the tubes that's pretty horrendous and UM people aren't as friendly as when you're out in the sticks because there's people everywhere whereas you might not see people for ages or miles if you go out for a walk out in the countryside. UM, so that's a bit annoying. UM I love the fact that I live UM, up in North London in quite a Turkish area so UM, there are some really good Turkish restaurants which is one of the good things about London as well. Now that's so multicultural. So that means that there's lots and lots of good food and the restaurants are really cheap where I live as well. UM, so that's pretty good but you have to be careful because of course it can be quite expensive if you go to the wrong places in Central which is a bit annoying. UM and uh there's lots of parks near me as well UM, so fintry Park is not that far away from me, m, which is quite convenient but you see some strange things there. ah, I saw someone practicing uh, their drum just on the grass when I was walking home once. UM, probably didn't want to cause too much noise and disturb their housemates so fair enough but probably not your usual instrumental choice. Uh I've also been to hyde Park as well but I don't go there that often m and there's a few sort of more local parks near where I am where they put on quite a few events as well so that's nice. UM, so if someone was new to the city I would suggest that they go to the welcome Trust UM, because there's all sorts of weird medical stuff there UM, which is really good. UM, the tate Modern is always good, although some of the art is a bit weird depending on what sort of things you like. UM uh m I haven't seen many of the tourist attractions UM, despite the fact that I used to grow up fairly near London and I live there now, so I've never been to the London Eye. UM, I'm not really sure what the big fuss is about and I don't know if I'll ever really pay that much to go up there. I've never really done the London dungeons or seen Big Ben. I think I spend most of my time at bars and the restaurant and sing music and stuff. UM, so I think there's a lot of things that I still have left to do but I think that's always going to be the case because there's sort of too much to do. The problem is when you live in London, there's.
