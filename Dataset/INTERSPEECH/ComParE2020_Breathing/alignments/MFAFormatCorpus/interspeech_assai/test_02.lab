Um, some things that I don't like about London is, ah, how busy and crowded it is always. um, I don't like how packed it is on the trains in the mornings, and londoners can be pretty rude. um I don't like that. um, there's not a lot of varied things to do in London. um, it seems like there are lots of fun things to do and lots of, uh, different things we can do in London. But everything is so expensive, so it's very difficult. um, I have a favorite restaurant in London, and it's a Malaysian restaurant. I go there quite a lot with my partner and I always order the exact same thing every single time. um, it's a restaurant that is in chinatown. um, and the food that I always order is a vegetable curry. um, it's quite spicy and I quite like spice. um, and whenever we go, it seems very busy, but we always end up sharing a table with strangers, which can be quite an enjoyable experience. um, whenever we go there, I always can never finish my food, so they give me a nice little takeaway box and I can then experience the same food again the next day, which is great. um, I have been to many parks in London. I've been to the big one, so hyde Park, uh, regents Park, um, but my favorite park to go to is Victoria Park, um, which is in East London. And that park is my favorite because there's always lots of dogs. And, uh, whenever I go there, I usually go to run, and I can always stop and pet some dogs, which is great. um, in the park, they also have a big fountain and a lake. And in the summer you can hire out the little, uh, boats, um, which was a disaster the last time I tried it, um, because I don't know how to row a boat. um, and when I was at the park and I tried to row the boats, uh, the fountain in the middle meant that the boat kept being pulled towards the center, uh, of the fountain, which was very difficult to then steer the boat. um, and all the people who were queuing up to also, uh, try out the boats were all pointing and laughing, which was great fun. um, uh, this park is also special because I used to go there with one of my aunts when I was really small. um, and there was also a big, uh, playground there when I was a kid, and we used to always, um, go there every weekend, um, when it was warm enough, and play on the, uh, equipment at the park. There used to be this huge, um, pirate ship that you could climb on, which was my favorite. um, there were also lots of squirrel squirrels, and we used to take nuts and feed the squirrels, which was really fun. um, if I met someone who just came to London. I would recommend that, um, they go to the theater.
