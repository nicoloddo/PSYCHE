So the Great pyramid of geez a bit made me think about churches and how much I hate going in them And when I read here that people might have been even paid for building the pyramid I thought fuck that When you go in churches all you know is that people were forced to build them and that we're supposed to like them and that they're emblems of the most corrupt organization in the world ever And I even hate the smell of them because when I was young I was taught by nuns and forced to go to church every Sunday and even serve on the altar at 07 00 in the morning one week a month um I've never quite forgiven churches and I even hate the smell of them When I read about William herschel I thought we always um concentrate on what people did that worked um uh similarly with Newton we concentrate on what he got right but he was also a nutcase and um he worked on alchemy and tried to turn lead into gold But herschel's bit of nuttery was that he actually believed that there were people who were living on the moon And he held quite strongly for a long period of his life um to the belief that he had seen evidence of structures like trees and I can't remember if there were buildings but other things uh on the moon that proved that there were uh people people who lived there Same is true for linus pauling who won I think he won two Nobel prizes one for chemistry and one for one for biology He was in a race with Watson and crick for DNA But he in later life had this mad notion that if you took lords and lords and lords of vitamin C um it would obey cancer And because I like to try things out I did that at one time And all it does is make you go to the bathroom an awful lot um The North Wind and the sun uh made me think of something that I've piece uh of music that I've been writing which is actually called The North Wind And I wrote it for um the impending death of one of my friend's grandmothers um that's what that made me uh think of And the poetry made me think of neuroscience um um and a project I want to get one of my undergraduates to do which is I can't remember the lab it came from but there's a great paper showing how language or different words are mapped in different uh in um semantic structures in the brain And I have a hypothesis that if you take a top 100 of shakespeare's metaphors and almost anybody else's because he's ruined it for everybody else um that the distance in these maps between shakespeare's metaphorical images the things that he uses and other peoples will be greater And that one of the things that makes him so great Is that he does actually stretch things across the he makes us travel greater distances um uh in our brain The Other thing that M the porn Made Me Think of is about Going To bed by day because I'm an habitual napper um this morning I had to meet a friend for breakfast at 10 00 She lives an hour away I live ten minutes away and I was 15 minutes late for A 10 00 breakfast because I really can't do mornings And uh I do go to bed Every day even if I come into the icm I'll go home for A nap in the afternoon And in my office I used to have a bed and I removed it because too many people in the icm were taking naps in my office And it began to smell um and um the second poem uh didn't um make me think of anything at all Actually So um I have nothing to say about that one Counting from one to 40 strangely made me think about Brian butterworth because um he Works on numerical cognition And uh he was one of the people who got me to uh be interested in how the brain processes uh numbers So that was what one to 40 made Me think of And then I Started To Get nervous because I thought oh gosh um
