data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/devel_00.wav|so my instrument and i've lived in london my whole life my favorite thing about london are the museums and of the community centers and yet to ease that you can do around now the pubs and the clubs i guess my favorite area would be south kensington around there at night's bridge to have loss of nice european food mast they have a talk about the things that you already get in other places in london i guess compared to where i live is nice apart as well that i have you have the bikes in london which did there isn't much in the rural areas as well but there are starts time to be bill out and i guess my favorite restaurant used to be nandles but it's now more i do like a buffer that there is a quite near my neighborhood so they serve lots of different types of food so they serve pizza and that my favorite food would be indian food to be honest late curry so it would be the curry and the chicken lamb and the different types of rises this displaces that they have which i do not some of the names and so they have the tales and stuff and stuff that was the pompo themselves which is something nice nothing nice which because of the indian my favorite fruit and yeah but i guess in london there isn't really too many indian places that i would go to to eight and so my favorite places would be close to my home in that regards and i guess i went to university in london and so while i was there that in impairer and south kansas and so that's another reason why sockets and is a favorite area of wine and then we have the other doing medicine so up when i was studying medicine i only done the best new the first year and so now i decided to work is still in london but you know also is interested in didn't research what was on the was interested in research that become an a fair prison psychiatrist by guess i was always thinking not you know i wasn't really into that the surgical aspects of medicine so we will see how to do every everything lenin calls but was really into kind of bodies and doing some of us are software up and find a different part and i i have referred it it'd be easy for me to start working out maybe go back to university letter on and so i'm i might go to imperial see little also from different courses that they offer similar things i guess i would still want to stay in london if i go to universe i guess got the idea of going to a place outside of london to local more rural area wouldn't be to entice it for me because i guess i have most of my school and earlier on done in a more rural saying than the london way and was there like the fact that it's near loss of different places different types of restaurants and stuff like that and i guess in london the best the best things usually are kind of just like in the senate so where you know where they have all the different museums like in lessons and square i'd recommend people to go to maybe the science museums and like the art museums|0
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/devel_01.wav|well i'm in london because primarily that's where my work is i e and working at the uclear institute which is on grave in road near king's cross and but i i've lived in london previously as well so they used to work in finance and i moved here for the first time in two thousand and one after finishing university i live mostly in around south london so was initially in east college then in the clap and then in kennington so at the moment i'm living in oxford and i'm down in london usually three or four days a week mostly just coming down into paddington or into malibun and getting the cheaper cross to king's cross but i do the various groups of friends here who i don't see as often as i would like to but when i do then i'll i'll tend to go down to central london or over to victoria where quite a few of my friends work or maybe go and stay with friends in cannington when i'm at in london though i've got i've got four memories of london as well from from those previous times and my brother used to live in east london and quite a few of his friends are still in that area so i see them fairly often and quite often end up going to concerts in london sometimes with my my dad who's also interested in music and sings and so we'll go to chamber music concerts for example some of the things i like about london are the fact that it's it's got this very rich history and the signs of that all over the place there are different levels of of london being built on top of one another so there are glimpses of those those lower levels or those earlier levels if you look hard enough and i do like the the cosmopolitan nature of the city the diversity of the people here the different languages you can hear spoken and the different cuisines that you can find and the fact that there's always somewhere new to explore so they'll always be a whether it's a museum or another restaurant or another neighbourhood i also like to just get on a bus and sit at the front at the top and look above the shop front level and look at the roofs of the buildings which again can reveal some of the londons history things i don't like so much about london include the rickety nature of some of the infrastructure the heat on the underground and although i engage in this behaviour myself the fact that it is sometimes quite isolated people do their own thing you get on the tube and there's not much i contact i don't really notice it too much when i'm in london but when i'm away from london i'm more aware of what london misses from that perspective other things i don't like about london i'm gonna move on to the next question actually so do i have a favorite restaurant or cuisine and is it available in london i i don't think i have a particular favorite i do enjoy chinese food having lived in china for a while and i there's plenty of chinese food here in london whether you were in chinatown so ho area or elsewhere i've got fun memories of a greek cypriot restaurant in katherine north which had wonderful meza and great bread that they used to make there and that also i enjoy that because it reminds me of times when i've been in greece for example in cretor and i was also had had a good holiday in the salamic have i been to any of the parks here in london while i yeart have been to several of them i don't spend as much time in the the big central ones like high park green park and since james's park but there are some nice open spaces else where when i was living in dallas in fact and maybe this isn't a park but|1
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/devel_02.wav|so i moved to london just over a year ago now to start a postoc job at ecl i guess i applied for a few different jobs and this is the one i got i initially wasn't that sure about moving to london because whenever i'd been here before it was often seemed quite big and intimidating and you know when you get the tube and then you come out for tube and you have no idea what direction you're facing or what exit you should go out of and you have to start walking for google maps leaving kind of catch up and tow which direction you're going in and that was kind of my experience of london of being disoriented and lost and i don't think it really helped that i spent a lot of time in the slightly like less nice parts of london because a lot of my friends moved here after we finished undergraduate and obviously no already had any money and a lot of them are still doing further study and stuff so they kind of lived in miles away parts of london like i guess burman see or shepherds bush market and stuff and so it's been a lot of time traveling just to get from one place to another or you'd go out with some friends and then you'd have to get like four night buses back to someone's flat where you could stay for the night or waiting for the bus back to oxford wars living at the time that's three o four in the morning from like notting hill and that's kind of intimidating and so i think i always got this impression of london is kind of quite cold and unfriendly and also somewhere where it's really inconvenient to get anywhere but i think actually just that at the time a lot of the people i knew lived in inconvenient places and well i guess that's obviously makes sense when you consider their students but most of london's not really like that and there are parts of london even though they're cheaper they're also a lot nicer and easier to get around to whereas i would not say west london is particularly always like that i think some of the things i like most ralendon are just that there's always something going on um there's always like a museum or an art gallery or a show that you've not seen and it's kind of nice to be able to wake up or morning and not have any plans in particular of what you want to do but still be able to find something really interesting that you'll really enjoy and not to patch like planet weeks or months in advance or for it to be like the same thing that you've done and seen before so that's one of the things i really like i also kind of like how i see more of my family them before because they come from near london say they're able to visit me off me more often although it does mean that my young guest sister kind of tends to turn up and it's like oh by the way can i stay with you tonight and i'm like yeah sure but maybe some notice would have been helpful yeah but i mean i guess she's kind of at that point in her life where she's just expirenting and visiting friends and forward planning isn't as important to her but it is nice even when she just turns up unexpectedly even if it's a bit stressful to like find some i've heard sleep or like um i don't know make sure she gets whatever trained she needs in the next morning it is nice that she feels that she can just turn up and be welcome and i think some of the things i don't really like by london how polluted it is i mean you can can't really see it and i don't think i've actually felt any effects of it but every soft and you have these like news bbc news articles or whatever come out that say the like most pollutive places in the city blooms reason pretty bad central london's pretty bad the tubes really bad and whilst you can't see the effect that has on your healthy kind of worry that maybe it is or maybe it will a few years down the line some of my family has asthma so it's kind of always a bit of a concern|2

data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/devel_11.wav|so i came to london because i decide to study abroad in my junior spring semester i chose london out of all the cities in the world because i've actually never been to europe or the uk so i was really intrigued and interested in like life in london the culture in london just i thought that those lot of things to like look look out and also explore about in london so i chose london as my final destination you see all was it was one of my top choices for school so study up because i like that a lot of schools around the area as well but my school back home is in the suburban role area and i also kind of grown up in like a suburban neighborhood and i really wanted experience what it was like living in a city and i thought that setting abroad during this time would be really great and i also enjoyed that you see all although it was in the center of london had its own campus which is something that i look very strongly in for schools which also decided my school back home as well i've only been in london for about two weeks but i really like how accessible everything in london is unlike things are like a few minutes walk here or a few minutes walk there and it's really great because it gets me to exercise as well which i would have never done back home at my school or anywhere in general to be honest i also really like how there is a variety of cuscines out london and i can really find like restaurants from all over the place like here which are like close and proximity or just like right next door to each other which i think is a great way to really try foods from other countries and also just kind of explore the culture of london uk itself another thing i like about london is how all the museums are free most museums are free i haven't gone to all of them yet but i've gone to some and i think it's a really great way to learn about history and a really exciting way as well some things i do not like about london i think this is not like specific to london but i don't like how early the sun sats it's kind of sad when i look out the costroom at like four thirty pm and it's super dark outside and sometimes i have events that have been at like six pm and walking in the window rain but it's definitely better than walking in the window rain at rochester so i guess it's like i saw that i don't like it it's just not something i look forward to i think another thing that i don't like about it might be just because i'm not like used to it but the crossing at london some people just go streets so i feel like i'm like too scared sometimes i like i'll put a foot down and then check i see that there's no cars and i'll try to go but then i get scared and i like go back to side off in their way into super long until the light changes sometimes i feel god because that everyone else has gone and i'm just there so that's just something i have to get used to do i have a favorite restaurant or cuisine yes i do it actually recently opened up the russia opened up near me at my home town it's called hide the law it's a chinese hot pot place and it actually is available in london in picadelli circus and i thought the other day when i went with friends just walk around so i'm very excited but there's something i'm familiar with and i can go back and try because it's a really really good hot hot place i really recommend it how i've been to any of the parks in london i actually haven't gone to any parks in london yet or any of the big parks i mean i've walked around some parks but i never went in i think that's definitely something i have to do because where i come from parks really honor thing we have like one state part near my house rochester because quite a bit of parks as well i just haven't gone which is probably something i should do there as well if i met someone new so i|11
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/devel_12.wav|i moved to london in twenty seventeen to start my masters at ucl at the institute of cognitive neural science incognitive neural science so i did that for a year and then i was applying for master's degrees for a second year as part of the same program that brought me here but i decided instead to start my phd so i started my phd at the icn as well in twenty eighteen and i'm doing that now i really love living in london it's completely different than where i'm used to i grew up in a very rural part of vermont in the u s so i'm very much not used to the city but i really like all the green space that london has i find that other cities i've been to like new york city and washington east washington dc just don't haven't quite enough green for me and feel very overwhelming because of tall buildings and very corporate field but i really like that london has lots of trees and parks and generally buildings that are not so high and i also love all of the free museums that's probably one of the fate one of my favorite things about living here you don't have to spend loads of money although it's easy to do that to going out and about in london some things that i do not like about london are the air quality again it being from a very rural part of the u s i mean too much different smelling and tasting air than in london i don't love that it doesn't get snow although i guess sometimes i do like that it's easier to commute in london and in vermont because you don't have to scrape off your car full of ice and wade through sometimes like five feet of snow to get to work even just to get to your car but i don't love the cold rain that you get especially this month in january when it's like big heavy wet cold rain i don't like that i don't like that it gets dark really early that's something i didn't expect when i moved here i thought being from really far north in the us would mean that i would be used to hours of daylight being relatively short but actually i think daylight hours in the in january at least are about one hour longer in vermont than in london so i struggle sometimes with the early sunsets and my other favorite my other least favorite thing about london is probably the two but although i actually really appreciate having effective public transportation so i guess that's also something i like and don't like my favorite restaurant in london is this place called now i can't remember life got is it's a greek restaurant on store street and it's delicious in general i love greek food and turkish food and my other favorite restaurant in london is a place called the pitted all live which is on least street not far away from the icn my favorite park in london is richmond park i'm not actually sure that that's yeah i know it is in london i love that you can see all of the deer running around and it's really fun to cycle around the whole park although it's very challenging i learned when i went for the first time there's a massive hill right before you get to the fun part but i really love richmond park i also love hyde park and regions park and the canal at regions park to if i met someone new to the city i would tell them to definitely check out borrow market which is a very traditional thing to say but it's probably the best thing i have ever experienced in my life we get the best all oil and she is from borrow market and i always tell people to go there not necessarily to buy pre made food but to buy ingredients to make food because i think they have wonderful ingredients i also would suggest that i always|12

data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/devel_14.wav|what brings me to london well i live in london so i have lived in london for most of my life it's most probably the favor my most favourite place in the world even though i have travelled been to other places but it's always london that that calls you back what are some of the things i like about london well i i like that it so varied there's so many different things to do in london so many different types of people yeah what are some of the things i don't like about london well it rains a lot it's quite cold it can get quite busy like there's there's a lot of people around it's one of the major cities of the world so there's obviously lots of tourism that's attracted to to london which is not necessarily a bad thing but i think when you're a london a and you're just trying to get around it can be quite difficult especially in the holiday seasons my favorite do i have a favorite i don't really have a favorite restaurant but my favorite type of cuisine is probably turkish food or anything that's like grilled meat so yes kind of like middle eastern mediterranean style food it's yeah it's very widely available in london puts particularly in in certain areas of central london like eduar road or places like that or night spring yeah so turkish food is is very tasty making me hungry right now even think king about it i have i've been to any parks in london and didn't do i have a favorite park i have been to pretty much most of the parks in london don't really have a favorite one but if i had to pick i would say regions park because it's in a really good location having said that so is hide park the both in really good locations depending on on what other things you want to do other than just going to a park and within the parts obviously there's other the there's sort of activities that you can do like boat riding etc stuff like that so it's it's pretty cool it's it's quite fun especially on a summer's day few mets if i if i met someone new to the city what would i recommend they go and see r this is a good one i think one of the things i really enjoy doing in london even though i might have done it more than once is visiting the museums in in south kensington and i would really recommend if somebody was new to the city to go and visit like the natural history museum and victory and i'll but museum i just think there's so much to see and so much to learn and when when you're a kind of a londonest from birth pretty much and you have schooled in london you visited these museums as a child but as an adult it's just there's just so much more value to actually going there and taking it all in the question have you been to any tourist attractions for example the ones i did you enjoy it was overheated i i have been of i've been a tourist in my own town|14

data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/test_01.wav|so i've come to london for multiple reasons firstly i got married in september and my now husband works at here in london say i moved here to join him here but also i got a job here it ecl to work as a post stock which was lucky given my husband was here say so that was that was kids london's quite different i was in oxford before which is a much smaller city and i find london quite busy and quite overwhelming and but we live quite far out so michael went to hell which i've heard described is just really not very like london given it is in london it's very quiet and fills quite suburban and we have a village green and it's quite nice say i actually like being able to escape the center and travel back out to the quiet suburbs but come in for work and have the option to come in and have all the attractions of london close by but not too close we did think about moving further in so that my commute would be better but we decided we just liked it further out where it was a bit quieter and like me isn't too bad it's thirty five minutes door to door which is pretty good for london so i feel like we kind of have the best of both worlds in that way but there are there are lots of things i like about london to like there are a lot of concerts here which is nice like we didn't have so many back in oxford so it's cool to get to see bands i like much more easily and the food as well me and my husband quite like going to restaurant stickly he likes quite posh places so when his mum comes to visit we clarify and go somewhere nice in london she really likes her good food to so yeah we've been to quite a range of different places round where we are there's a lot of italian restaurants not quite sure why i think there's called a big italian community which it's probably my favorite term food so that's quite nice and so yeah we enjoy going out for for food quite a lot and the parks in london are called to we have quite a few round where we are but i like the fact that even in the center you have these quite big open spaces that you can go to i really like hide park for example that's really nice but most of them are a pretty nice so i definitely recommend those to people coming to london for the first time i think the parks are one of the best things about london but there's this kind of there's all sorts something i would probably recommend if someone was new to the city would be something called the wallest collection which is kind of like this old house where six centric old man used to live i think maybe he was an architectural something but he collected a lot of different things a lot of random bizarre things and they're all in this house and it's just a really interesting collection of objects and civil buildings kind of full thrown in together and that's quite cool and i'm not sure many people know about that so that's probably what i would recommend to someone it's a good if they when you say to london but i haven't really been to many of the other sort of big tourist attractions like that london i i do there i think they're just often so busy and a full of people that i tend to stay clear probably more i've been to tourist attractions in terms of shopping|17

data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/test_04.wav|so i'm a very big fan of restaurants especially in london i think one of my favorite things is going to new restaurants and i read a lot of restaurant reviews to find out restaurants to go to i'm quite proud of the fact that i often tend to be the person to pick reference i go to friends i think have quite good taste in restaurants so in terms of a favorite restaurant i'd say that i would prefer going to a new restaurant to one that i've already been to but some very old reliable ones are quite like caravan which is a very nice chain of restaurants around london there's one in bank side this one in king's cross and they do really good sharing plate type food of rest once i haven't been to yet that i really like to go to black acts mangle is a very exciting looking turkish combat restaurant but done buyer proper sheff used to be at november it's quite odd to this quite posh food but then it's done in a restaurant that constantly plays heavy metal so i quite like to go that but they only have tables for about twenty people so that's my list of places i'd like to go to and has my favorite cuisine again i'm not quite sure it is quite like things that are new i spend time on instagram scrolling through looking at food funding new feet to eat saw a recipe recently in the garden from oslangi for a choco flan where you put in the cake mixture first and then the custard for the plan and then in the oven they swap places seen it with the flan on the top and the cake on the bottom which i think is really interesting i'd want to make it just going to see that so yeah what brings me to london will i grow up here i grew up in north london in mozzare hill and i went to school there then left a couple of years to get to uni and then very quickly decided that i probably wanted to do the rest of my studies and working in london so now i'm doing my phd a uco in euro science and i've stayed in london ever since but at the start of next year and twenty twenty i get moving to edinburgh for a couple of months to work with my entry partner for my phd where we will be developing the app for my project i'll be really exciting and i think eliberate looks like a really amazing city i tend to prefer to live in cities robert smaller places i think just having grown up with having everything within arms length then ways open i think it'd be quite odd going somewhere where you kind of have to do everything between nine and five um i think we bit depressing also i don't drive which is definitely a very north london thing so i would find it quite hot to leave a city but i'm very excited by moving to edinburgh for a short period of time what are some of things i like about london will have already listed a few missus so much to do in london and it's just so cultural and there's great food as i have mentioned at some length ps i definitely find it hard to leave london what do i not like about london i think some of things other people don't like about london and saying that london is quite cold quite harsh an unfriendly place i quite like that i quite like the anonymity that you have living in a big city i'm not sure what i don't like for london maybe i'll find out i mean i realize that it's a lot better have i've been to any of the parts and then i have been to some of the parks in london i quite like some james park i think it's quite nice i like the terror pens and the pelicans they have the which i think fun i grew up next to park or ali paley which that's just a really nice parking lot of my memories are either going for walks in a pale of my door with friends i don't know being a team|20
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/test_05.wav|i first came to london to start my mse and then to do my phd because i really wanted to work with someone here at ucl so i moved to london but it's not actually somewhere i ever wanted to move umm at first i found it really big because i grew up in quite small cities and things take a really long time to get to places but actually as i've lived here i've enjoyed it a lot more yeah i've found public transport here is is really good generally but once i started cycling in london that was really great because it's a lot faster to get to different places and there are some really good cycle routes to and from work for me i find it a bit more scary to cycle on routes that i don't know because there's a lot of traffic but it's generally really good and good to get some exercise i also quite like traveling on the bus rather than on the tube because it's much nicer to be above ground than underground and it's also really noisy on the tube i i don't really have a favorite restaurant in london but i there are some really nice ones um particularly ethiopian food which i'm going to tonight i'm looking forward to um yeah there are there are lots of different styles of food we also like to go to efficient place quite near us that has really good quality fish and also great hello me which is really good yeah yeah i really like the area of london that i'm in i think my my favourite bit is hamstered heath and going to places like kenward house because you can sort of escape london a little bit and get to somewhere a bit quieter and there are really great views of london from there that if you climb up the hill especially in the evening it's really nice to climb up the hill and just look over the city when the lights go on yeah really good views and actually from the top of hampshire heath as well there's great panorama's of of all of the city but you feel nicely removed from the city which is really good and also at kenwit house they have really good tea and scones and yeah it's just a really nice place to walk and see lots of people with their dogs and they have good lakes there as well and places that you can swim in well some people swim their all the around which seems a bit mad and freezing cold i've swung there once in the summer on a boiling hot day in the middle of a very hot summer and it was so cold my hands sort of cramped up so i don't know quite how they manage it in the middle of winter but there are people who swim in sort of all year but it does get really busy in the summer particularly when it's hot and that's a really fun thing to do in london so that's definitely the place i take visitors when they come and see me in london is actually not to the sort of classic sites like the london i or anything really in the centre maybe because lots of my friends aren't massively keen on big cities or loads of people um so we tend to go walking instead in places that are a little bit quieter|21
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/test_06.wav|i took a walk in since james's park i think that's a poem somewhere which is rather rude which i'm not going to recite here but it's a restoration poem by the rochford i think and he went something instant james's part that's worse than jinson james is parks a very nice park i quite got it going for a walk there that's got all the all the sites of london that you might want to see when the booking and palace and the back at downing street and horseguards parade but if you walk offs and james is park and you get to green park it say equally very nice it might seem rather boring because there's no flowers there it's all green hence its name and apparently this story goes that the mistress of some king or other and i'm gonna say george the fourth bar i could be wrong lived across the park from since it for death from green park think she lived somewhere near the mall not them all what's that street called as a street piccadilly street piccadilly something anyway near green park the station she lived there before the station was built and the old king used to cross over the park on his way to go in you know have his merry way with his mistress so the queen was quite jealous of this she insisted that the park he walks through must not contain any blooms or flowers so she set a decree to make sure that he would always be remembered that the park he walks through on his way to his mistress would be devoid of colour however i think it's quite a nice part so now we go now walking further along i think you get to height park which is ginormous even though ginormous is not a an appropriate word i think but hide park is it is interesting if you want to go for a long walk or a cycle i'm not a big fan of it it's very often the park where people go to see things at speaker's corner which used to be rather interesting back in the day when it was sort of very innocent and just some weird preacher but now people want by thinking i wonder if this is going to be the next major terror wrist mister minutes five minutes don't goodness gracious if i messed it up by stopping so if i continue along the park into hyde park and i what past the would be terrorists or crackle wait which week we are do people and that you don't see them these days not as much as as once upon a time you might have done and when you do there's often a big police pleasant present so it's it's not a very pleasant place to spend a lot of time however if your own roller blades it's grant to go scooting round the park that way though i would say if my favourite part was in london it would probably be the part next to my house it's not really a park it's more of a little grave yard and which might seem a bit more bit but it's very pretty and it has nice flowers in it and people often walk their dogs and i quite like a part with a lot of dogs i like dogs that i'm quite dog brudy i would have a dog myself if i could keep one in the flat if i walk further on to the next park near by its a bit crap so i don't go there very often victoria park which i used to think was the biggest but isn't as another fine park it's one along the canal side so if you want to go a cycle and go along the grand union canal and to victoria park and have an ice cream it's a grand day out in there i believe there's a little oriental garden in the middle of the pond which again is a nice little visit going south of the river we could get to and crystal palace area and the crystal palace parks pretty grand that's quite impressive where it used to have the and the old crystal power srickers its name which was the former site of the grand exhibition of where the grand exhibition was relocated to to|22

data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/test_13.wav|okay i i've always quite slagged london most of my families here so i guess i would say perhaps family is the main reason but i also i like the fact that it's so green and it's quite multicultural and there's just so much things to do so any places to go so yeah i would say that's what brings me him in terms of things i like about london i would say i like the green spaces and i also like the father there so many restaurants and there's always something to do like it never really sleeps there's always something to do so i you can never really get bored i think there's so many like free museums and the galleries and all of that so yeah in terms of what i don't like what i said don't like about london it's a bit too busy sometimes it can be a bit too fast based i think so i think it needs to slow down sometimes this would be too fast and also i think people don't look out for each other as much as they should people can be unkind but i guess it's a cultural thing i perhaps do it sometimes as well so yeah i would perhaps say that's i do i have a favorite restaurant and not necessarily actually i wouldn't say i have a favorite restaurant in london yeah i wouldn't say perhaps i need to guess i would see more restaurants to be able to make judgments on that but i wouldn't necessarily say i do in terms of the parts i do as i said like that's one of the favorite my favorite things about london i quite like the green spaces and i would say my favorite i haven't been to all the pogs but if i were to ultimately choose a favorite one it would perhaps be ham said heath although richmond park is a close second but i i really really like hamster heap i would say try all the museums in the galleries i think there's just so much to learn they're so fascinating and they're also free which is not very common in other countries so i would say definitely for starters try all the museum and museums and gather is and yeah that would be my recommendation i have been to i haven't actually been to the london i as yet but i haven't been on the river things though the the boat ride and you basically get a very nice view of all the the money men send basically all the attractions in london and it was nice i wouldn't say it was overrated necessarily but i think it was just okay it was it was a nice activity to do but i would definitely like to try the london i at some point and perhaps madam to solids i've actually never been there as well but i think that would perhaps be overrated because i guess from my understanding is just basically walks school|29
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/test_14.wav|i came to london about six years ago to study i had finished my high school studies and i once come to university so i did two years of what they call sixth form here in which i did a math physics and economics after that i went to university in another part of london in north part of england and so i left london for a few years and then now come back to work and finish up my studies one of things the few things that i do like about london is the level of diversity that london brings london is a multimalk pot with people from different cultures from different countries and funny things everything works here in london people get along with each other there was a sense of community and there's a sense of understanding even though people are probably not going to talk to you in the streets but if you need help there's a high chance that they will help you and i just really love that sense of spirit and lessons understanding and some of the things i do not like while london is it is just too expensive the city is so expensive it feels like every time i breathe this money coming out of my pocket when i'm an account it is not the best another thing that i do know like my london is when traveling on the tube during peak times or rush hour is just so full people have really time compared to breath but then again it ties back to the understanding that everyone understands that this is what you have to go through to live in this wonderful city so one of my favorite restaurants in london would have to be benihana and they have three and occasions in st paul's picadilly and in chelsea i love beniana because the japanese food and absolutely love japanese food the seasoning the fresh fish the sushi the beef the tariaki sauce is just absolutely amazing it's well it's everything i can eat it every day but we see expensive so i can't and when it comes to parks in london i haven't been to that many parts of london a bin to hide park and i've been to read this park and these are really nice parts in the summer you can sit down have a meal just look at the view and just take it all in to really really great experience between the two i think i would probably go for high park just because you can get to herrods quite fast i think it's hard harrison we did park as well yeah i've never done it but i think you should be able to because they're quite close to each other so if i if someone you came to london and had to recommend somewhere for them to go wow i would probably recommend you know the terrorist attraction such as buckingham palace and big band i see hyde park just for them to be on the night i should shared just for them kind of sea london toys perspective into experience the culture the london has to offer i'd also take some terrorists on the not so toys the parts but parts that have such great street food such as an area shortage hackney i shouldn't canada wolf as well because that's really really nice like the business district of london roll the bake so the big corporations answer the big big banks are located and i haven't been to that many substructions myself london just because i don't know if i when you live here you always have this thing that's you had they know i could always go so i bother groups today but i haven't been to any but i|30
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/test_15.wav|okay so things that i like favorite restaurant electrically favorite restaurant i went to sketch the other day which has an amazing ambience and ethereal ambiences if you're in another world as each room has a different color and different amazing decor so the orientalist section makes you feel a bit that you're actually in china and then them lose the toilets are amazing because they like like space polls so you go upstairs to separate section it if you're entering into a different universe you could say we all these the toilets in the form of white pubs also what i like what the restaurant it was so tasty very very incredible the best what i think the best c pan fried see best which is smokes i've ever tried in my life so the food is absolutely amazing to service was also very polite for a spot on so anybody can go and it's a modern british cuisine you could say so european fair and anybody can go and book in the different restaurants okay so some things i like about london the fact that it's there's a lot of things to do the sorts of culture pursuits you could never they say you could never be bored in a place like london what you do do not like about it it's not a very relaxing place to read it's quite aggressive so if you want to have relaxation it's better to live outside of london and then to come inside to london if you have to work figure parks do i have a favorite favorite park i like call height park work during the winter one the land time because it has all these amazing activities to do and gives a very christmas sort of feel any too instructions i like i think the taravelon is the best tourist attraction is to spend the whole day and then when there's lots of things to see lots of interactives to take part in and you get the very tasty sausage roles and sausage and pies over there i find as well someone to knew would you recommend so i recommend they go see terrified them i recommend if they want to go on a tour you can go in an afternoon t london boss that takes you round while serving you on off to what it's a cold b and b's bakery i think i'd recommend you go and hang out in coven garden to see older the energy in the vibe and older theatrical performances in the cute independent shops that still are in covent garden i'd recommend to go to greenwich which is like a hidden part of london people don't go out to see so much you get the best vantage from easy greenwich merging line you quote walk up the hill to the astronomy museum and you can have the best view of london and then also experience maritime london where going to the cutty sock an old tea clipper ship and it feels like you're in continental europe not really like in london so that's a nice place to see|31
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_00.wav|yeah so i'm in london right now because i am doing a phd and cognitive nearest science i was living in cambridge when i was doing my master's degree and i was really interested in studying here in london because you see is a really great school for neuroscience it's highly productive there's lots of really interesting stuff going on lots of talks and it just seem like a good place to apply and my supervisor at cambridge strongly recommended that i got in touch with my current supervisor here you see and one thing led to another and now i'm here and i've been here for three years now so one of the some of the things i like about london i think it has really really great community i know it's cliche to say that london's vibrant but it it really is it's so multi cultural multi lingual people look after each other i've been on the tube by the bus so many times where someone's needed help and people russian yes so i just i really appreciate how people look after each other and the sense of community and solidarity it's kind of almost feels like the utopian dream sometimes the way that we can all work together in this big city so some of the things they don't like about london are there is it pretty extreme in a quality here so you see really really poor people lots of rough sleepers and then you also see people who are like oil tycoons and finance people and it's kind of it's sad that there's so much inequality in the society here and i'm also not a big fan of the pollution it's it's definitely it takes its tool on your quality of life in terms of favorite food or cuisine in london i am a big fan of indian and bingo deshi food there's lots of great stuff here in london although i've been told birmingham is the place to go for really good indian i also have a few favorite chinese restaurants and and yeah basically you can get any cuisine you want in london have i been to any of the parks in london yes so i go to parks all the time i like to run and i tend to run in places like hamster heath the most because it's a big park lots of nature especially given the pollution in london it's a really nice place to sort of reconnect with like trees and greenery if i met someone new to the city i would definitely recommend they check out the parks or just walk around the neighbourhoods like leave the center of the city because the tourist stuff is really impressive it's definitely worth walking along south bank for example but i think where london really shines is the small neighborhoods places i didn't discover until i moved here in terms of tourist attractions i did go because someone took me as a guest to the dungeons i was act so i went in with like pretty low expectations but i actually ended up having a pretty good time it was spooky sure but mostly it was actually pretty entertaining especially given like the actors who kind of like jump out at you i would say they try and kind of make it like educate meant and you learn about london's history i don't know how successfully but i feel like if you're with someone who really wants to go share take the|32
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_01.wav|for what brings you to london to do a first to do a m rs here at the icn and then to do my phd here something as i like about london or is all all the stuff to do they just have really amazing museums that are completely free and so much music comes here that we can we can go and see that just is not accessible in and many other parts in the world people are generally like really really friendly and yeah it's just there's so much so much to do and so much to be exposed to and to learn but i don't like how horribly crowded it is and how it's just sometimes if you like it this constant overstimulation walking near leicester square is horrible and i try to avoid it at all times especially dying christmas when it's just especially crowded with tourists being on the northern line in the morning or right after work i try to skip that but either coming in by eight in the morning or coming in after ten because i really really hate being in someone else's armbit based on my size so that's definitely my least favorite thing also everything is covered in plastic like it's really hard to find fruits and vegetables that aren't aren't coded in that plastic so i'm trying trying to avoid that we got a new new box of fruits and vegetables that be like a lot more my favorite restaurant in london is definitely padella by in brown market because it's extremely good fresh pasta it's it's like the best that i've ever had and it's really cheap it's like five to seven pounds please depending on what you're getting so i can eat a ton of boston it's really delicious except it's really popular so i can only get in there for lunch because getting a dinner reservation you can't call the head you have to be there actually like stand there checking on the app and leave and it never works so can't be bothered but for lunch it's really really good so i bring lots of people to go there with me any of the parks in london i'm really close to ms heath so really familiar with that i like that one lot but in terms of general walking around it's a regions park is is nicer it has a lot more things to look at but running through him stead heathers is a lot more interesting because not just flat if i met someone new to the city well if they were if they were tourist i always have my friends go to the tower tour even though it's expensive it's really worth it because it's it's interesting and it's not something that you get to see anywhere else i also like going to q gardens if it's warm so those are its those are too really different thing is that i think it's more it to see that and i have a list of restaurants there that are nice tourist attractions i have been to the london i went there the first time that i came over with my end that was actually really cool i don't feel the need to do it again oh but i i enjoyed being on it so i i wouldn't i wouldn't say it's overrated just not necessary not necessary to do twice the vna is a big big tourist one that's really nice that they have a lot of really interesting glass work there that i enjoy seeing the room where you walk in it's all just hundreds of jesuses staring at you is kind of kind of odd but they have also really good traveling exhibits there i saw a solid and underwear that was nice that's right across the street from harrods which i do not recommend going to and avoid it all costs unfortunately anyone who wants to come visit always wants to go there so i try to say have a lot of work to do at that point and just not go because i hate i hate really hitting there but the catholic originally is also right there and that's a beautiful|33

data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_03.wav|uh as i moved to london in two thousand and ten when i started at university at ucl so first i studied speech and language therapy and i did the undergraduate program air which was four years i have said before that i lived in working which wasn't isn't too far away from london anyway and but after that i moved away from london for uhm another two years and moved back home to working and then moved back again in well about three years ago back to chisex now i live in london full time as there's some things i like about london i love that you can kind of do anything you want at any time you want and there's never a boring weekend there's always something more to go and see or to go and look at or that you haven't visited before even if you are revisiting things that you really like i also love that it's really easy and to get around town so there's loads of ways to travel i am on the overground and underground and on the buses so it's really easy turkey out and about a the other thing i love is that and they have lots of are vegan options in london so i became vegan in january this year and found that there's so many options available in and around london but these kind of reduce quite a lot when you go out of london so it's really great that to have the all these options available on your doorstep some things i don't like about london i hate my commute so i have to commute in from west london every day and it takes me about an hour each way and it's definitely the worst part of my day and i hate having to go home in the dark in the evening on the tube and then walk another ten minutes in the rain i'd love to live a bit closer and that i can't uh what else did i like about london it's really busy all of the time and you can't stand still anywhere cause there's always someone i'm trying to get past you but i also really like that aspect of london that it is busy and there's always a good atmosphere wherever you go erm i don't really have a favorite restaurant in london tend to eat in quite a few different places don't tend to go back to the same place but like i said i vegan so always are looking for new places to try but they typically tend to be in east london which is kind of annoying because i live in west london and so it's a little bit of a track there and to go and visit a few of those places if i met someone new in the city i'd probably recommend that they go and visit all the different kind of little suburbs in london so kind of north london is obviously really different from and south and east london and they've all got their own character and they're all own vibe going on so it be kind of a miss if you didn't go and see all of those different areas to get a real fill for the city and i say get out of central london get out of all the tourist traps and just go and see where people live and go and see some of the smaller areas and have a little wand around and you'll always find something interesting to do i haven't actually been to that many of the terrorist attractions i think i've been on the land and i about ten years ago and went to the london dungeons otherwise tend to try and avoid them cause they're always very busy and very expensive um london i was good maybe a little overrated maybe a little overpriced but it is an icon and so i can see why people would want to cover and have a go on it okay what i shall i talk about have i been to any of the parks in london and yeah i used to live on garage street so my local part used to be reading|35
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_04.wav|mm i came to london to go to school to go to university college london initially for the masters program in cognitive narrow science at the institute of congress normal science ucl and i've stayed in london to continue in cognitive neural science by doing a phd program here at the icn on my second year now and i'll probably stay in london and tell i'm finished and there's a few things i like about london at first the things that i didn't like so much or now in ways things that i do like there's a great deal available to you at you know a great convenience there's anything you want any kind of food or whatever you need you don't have to get in a car and you know drive half hour to get there everything's very close by that makes things convenient i like that that there's a lot to do there's a lot to still explore tons of museums there's a lot of restaurants i like to go to a number of restaurants particularly i would say my favorite is probably frankle monkas they have really good pizza and i have also explored a lot of different parks in london such as hyde park in a russell square gardens and ah regions park and as tons of parks if i had to choose a favourite i really like hyde park and i would maybe say that's my favour in london at least there's a lot in the uk if someone was new to the city i would recommend that they see a number of different sites and things such as museums and um those are always really interesting they're free some of it can be boring but you just gotta explore round and figure out what interests you in what you like i really like the british library going there for the first time is really cool they have a like artifact treasure room there that has also to really interesting old objects books and literature and paintings and i'd also probably recommend that someone knew to london visit thee the british liberal not the british library the british museum that's just a cross from brussels square gardens its massive you could spend days in there have been there maybe three times and there's still all sorts of different rooms and exhibits i haven't even gotten to yet um there is also the more touristy attractions such as the london eye which i haven't been to yet um but i have done some other kind of more less touristy things i've visited|36
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_05.wav|um i was born in london i have been in west london for all of my life of twenty seven now i was born in hillington hospital in hounds low which is in west london and it is on one end of the piccadilly line near to heathrow airport some of the things i like about london are that is very easy to get around erm you can meet lots of different people from all around the world and try a lot of different things particularly food music travelling is very easy from here what are there some of the things i don't like that london it's very crowded i don't do well in crowds it can be really grilling me especially in the winter which seems to last for about nine months of the year it rains a lot also i don't like that it's quite great in terms of even the buildings and the pavements and everything is great except in the summer it's fine the one thing that is good though is that you can easily get to green spaces apparently there are so many trees in london that it would actually officially be counted as a forest but obviously they're not all in the same place so it doesn't always feel like that do i have a favorite rest wrong i like i'm not sure actually mm-hmm mm mm mm have i been to any of the parks in london and do i have a favorite park yes i do it's actually not one of the big ones my favorite park is ostelli park which again is in west london where i live it's you can get to that on the big dilly liners or if you suppose delete station but it's one of their national trust properties and it's a bit of the way so doesn't get a lot of people going there but it's got a big house really big grounds used to belong to a family who i think owned most of that area but they've just turned the park bit of it international trust property then it's got a lake and a river and you can go canoeing on the river and they have like swans and ducks they also have rabbits and if you go doing by the end of march beginning of april you can usually see baby ducks and baby rabbits um so it's really nice they also have cows horses to gives because they have a small working farm on the park so it's quite fun if someone was new to the city i would say probably go and see the parks because they're a good escape from the general hustling bustle and sometimes you need a break from that i'd say do all the touristy things because some of them are quite fine and i think especially if you live here and you've been here a long time you do miss out and doing this we also have lots of nice museums and you can usually spend an entire day walking around one museum one particular thing that i like doing is every year they have the national photographer the nature photographer of the year and they present all the pictures in the natural history museum and that's always good to go and see i haven't really been to any of the tourist attractions like the land and i we went on school trips so i've been to like madam to swords and the london dungeons and stuff like that um generally i'd they are probably overrated i like more than nature stuff and parks and things like that and also going round museums at my own pace other things to do in london would include i think one thing that i'm interested in doing is just going to random stations because sometimes when you're on a line so for example i take the big dealer line every single day to work but i only go up to certain point and i always wonder what is the rest|37
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_06.wav|so i moved to london because my partner is studying at university college london he is working on getting his phd in cognitive neuro science and we decided that it would be fun if i moved here as well so i came from the united states and i have been living here now since the twenty ninth of january two thousand nineteen so almost a full year it's been a very exciting journey it took me approximately eight or nine months to be able to make the move happen i worked as an respect home for almost two years and i had to go through an entire process to get my nursing license in my visa in order and now i work here and reading as a nurse new work on antibd's hermatology word and which is very different than the nursing i used to do i was previously a nurse in the intensive care unit and often worked with patience after cardioc surgeries earners and surgeries as well as various medical conditions like respiratory failure and now i am dealing primarily with medical patients who are generally not a sick and my patient were clothes much larger as well i was previously only working with two to three patients and now i work with an average of eight to ten patients which is quite a large difference so it was a very large adjustment period when i first came here i had to adjust first of all just to having more patience so there is a lot of prioritization and uh delegation that i needed to quickly learn in order to be efficient and practice safe nursing care um luckily i have been working with a great team and the team that i work with are from several different countries the nhs is currently having a massive nursing shortage so they often bring it nurses from the eu as well as other countries the agency i went through is actually based on the pilot and so there is a large philippine population at our hospital um as well as people from spain portugal um all over africa america is surprisingly as i have yet to meet another americaners but that's alright as so it's been it's been fun getting to know everyone from all these different countries and to have people with sort of a similar experience so um that definitely helped my transition period um and now the great friends and recently i got two experience with the nhs is like as a patient because i had a very severe chest infection when i had to go in ane and for a temperature of forty and my heart rate was over one thirty and they nearly admit it meets the hospital but likely i got a little better with some fluids and avian tobiotics uhm but it was uh it was very uhm interesting because it didn't really i had never even seen my my gp yet let alone go to any so he was messaging all my co workers my friends trying to figure out what to do and they were a great support system during that time which was really nice and it was actually quite a good experience apart from|38
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_07.wav|yeah again and so i came to london to do a master's degree and and my i grew up in dublin but my dad is actually english so am i actually have some family in england so it's quite nice coming over to see them because we never never really redoctors with which is quite bad and i'm actually actually living with my uncle at the moment for this year and so it's quite nice to get to know them better because they're really nice and my anti has an unteach up so it's quite exciting or just quite interesting getting to go and there meet her friends because she's friends though these interesting artists and illustrators and and i really like in london so far this well it's really really big and it's just so much going on all the time and so many different events like that quite overwhelming really you can't keep it for the more and you want to see everything and i really like the other day i saw at the power keeps in the park and i turned by them but i hadn't seen them and it's just really nice and expected at wacky kind of thing and it kind of fits the city i think that their wild parking seem that there shouldn't be and i don't like how big london is in a way just because it takes a base an hour to get to the other side or even further like anywhere you you want to go in the weekend you've to travel for ages and and i'm not used to that because it takes like two hours to cross ireland entirely so it just seems like seems a bit ridiculous i've never spent that long and public transport and i really like all the market food stores and and all the different types of cuisine because again we didn't have that in in ireland is just like craffy mexicans with burritos or italian but the there isn't really much variety and and i found this really really nice malaysian restaurants at by eastern station last week and and it looks like fast food restaurants and looks like it's real attacky and not great food but that when you get in there is actually unbelievable food and it was really cheap and i haven't been to too many of the parks and i have a list on my phone of all the parks i need to go to and particularly i really want to go to home city and add try go swimming and i i don't think i'm gonna get to do it before i go home but i i had intended on trying to go for killed swim because and at christmas in dublin every year we have to jump in the sea and it's really killed so it's going to try prepare for that so i don't look like too much of a win when i'm at nervously edging in front of all my friends but i'm yeah i don't think i'll get a range of that and and apparently there's like a slow on other results so i'd like to check that it should send quite cool and i've been through i went to winter wonderlands in and hide park and that was an experience it was definitely very christmas eve and it is really nice because it was my birthday and people from home flew over to visit me so and we went i went in there with them and we couldn't get him for ages because the key was really big so then by the time we did get in it was just full of really drunk adults and there is not a child in size even though the big fair ground and so that was quite fun we got a lot of mold wine and yeah very touristy bush good event and and if i met someone new to the city what would i recommend one thing i have been obsessed with is and i think i need stuff going because it's a bit getting a bit much but every time the tape modern has a late night like the last friday of every month i always go and add people are telling me i need stop going to the taste but they're really cool events and they have those workshops and if you join the take collective which is|39
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_08.wav|i have lived in london since i was born i've lived in my whole life and so i'm i'm a little bit sort of blaze about it i guess i don't see as many benefits as some people do but i do still like the city um some things that i like most about london is the the people so i think the the range of people in london is really unique and i love am going to know people from different places and with different experiences and things um something else i like about london a lot is that um there's always something going on so you can always find something to do if you want to umm and there's kind of unique stuff that doesn't happen so much in other places like you know there's always some new kind of shop opening or a new kind of event happening or something like that um but there's a few things i don't like about london so i think my lease favorite thing is there's no there's not much green space um so i definitely like to be are in london but just with more greenery and more nature um that's my lease favorite thing but i also don't like how it's so busy that sometimes people don't take the time to talk to each other or even notice each other and they just sort of go about their business every day um so i would say that i'm overall i really like london but it definitely has its ups and downs and if i if i move out of london i'd like to go somewhere with a sort of more more of a small community feel and definitely like more access to nature like mountains or forests lakes or stuff like that um so my favourite cuisine is um like japanese food does quite a lot of it available in london um but i i have like a a favour at restaurant as well um it's probably tokyo diner which is no less the square um and it does really really nice vegetarian japanese food so i've i'm vegetarian as well and it's sometimes quite difficult to find japanese food without fish um or pork so yeah i really appreciate that they they do really good like food with tofu or with other sort of vegetarian substitutes that don't have metal fish and my favorite food that they do there is the toffee cats you curry uhm i have been to a lot of parks in london but i definitely want to explore them more so my favourite is probably hampson heath just because it's so big and there are so many dogs there i really like dogs umm so yeah my favorite is probably hampson heath but i haven't actually been to richmond park which is kind of crazy because i've lived here all my life but yeah i kind of always feel like i will do it one day but just never sort of get round to it because i just i know it's sort of not gonna go anywhere so i definitely want to do that same dangers park is also really nice i like the the water there and the birds and stuff like that um that's something i really like about london as well even though it's um an urban environment there's a lot of birds and in the morning you can hear bird sole and things switch is very nice um if i met someone that was new to the city i would definitely recommend they go to the heath in fact whenever someone's visiting i always recommend they go there because quite few people visit london but don't know about the heath ant answered heath so yeah i think it's really nice and there's so much of it to explore and get to know and it's kind of a way you can feel like you're away from the business of the city while being still very much within the city um sorry i recommend|40
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_09.wav|mm um i have come to london because i am doing a masters at university college london i am studying applied pedetric nearer psychology in the its sheet of child health and i'm in london because i live near london and i can't afford to do masters far away from home and i have to commute because i only get a loan that doesn't even cover my course fees ummm yeah i talk about my course so we have a very weird cost structure where it only in eight weeks of the year but when we're in we're in nine thirty to five thirty monday to friday and the rest of the time i spend in the icn doing my master's research project um we're looking at mentalising abilities in children with genetic syndromes conferred to children with autism and typically developing children yeah uhm yeah i don't know what what to say i'm sorry okay i'll just read them through i guess so are you gonna tell me when a minutes are poor okay i'll just do the next question then so some things i like about london is there so much to do and i like going to watch bands play and that's lots of that going on in london it's easy to travel quite far because of the tube i don't like the tube though is really crowded and gross i don't like how expensive london is i don't like how it's not very green um yeah my favourite cuisine is indian food and yet there's later india restaurants in london especially in like brixton area i have been to some parks in london bid to hide park and green park erm i don't think i really have a favourite though they just parks um although high pox call when went to underlines there uhm yeah if i met someone new to the city ermh i would recommend they see it like the main tourist attractions like thee ern like big ben and the london eye and bucking pallia stuff like that um i have been to those tourist attractions i never been on the land and i though i think they're ok but you get used to them when you live here um some shows ok so i saw the lying king for my eighteenth birthday and i thought it was amazing it moved me my month cry i've also seen wicked and i think that was really cool i saw stomp when i was in school yeah i don't really like like traditional musicals but i thought those were really good erm yeah and i go and see later bands playing in london i'm going to see the liberties tomorrow in brixton so that would be cool yeah and like loads of stuff in cabinet and go to uhm it's really difficult i run out of things to say now yeah you could just say that plot of one of the music is ok the lanking yeah so is about a baby lion and he's the sun i was like the king kind of in blind terms of the tribe and yeah it's about like his father dies in the story and it's about him like growing up and learning his responsibilities and he falls in love with this logo lion could i can't remember her name i have a watch the lanking in a long time um yeah|41
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_10.wav|so i moved to london i guess two and a half years ago and i moved here with my partner at the time who was doing a masters and music at the royal academy of music studying violent performance and since then i have gotten a job at the british library and that i guess is what keeps me in london because i like my job and i like being here some of the things that i like about london i love how much is going on culturally i think there's just so much to do at all times which is really valuable i think it's really cool that if you want to see a play there's not like i come from a smaller city in there maybe you want to see a play you've got two options max here i don't know there's like thirty things you could go and see just looking at theater never mind looking at dance or music or like opera or ballet or anything really there's just so many options and i love that i also love how like culturally diverse it is and i think that really contributes to really strong cuisine there's just food from all over the worlds and i love eating and so that's really nice and i lake a lot of the parks in london i think that there's a surprising amount of green space for a city of this size and i also think the architecture is really beautiful and really diverse i think there's some really interesting brutalism and there's also just like beautiful victorian homes so many beautiful victorian homes some of the things i don't like about london would be the pollution think you can feel that the cities bad for your health and that's not something that i'm used to and i don't love that they say that if you take the two before an hour its equivalent to smoking a cigarette and that's like just a way of getting around that's not even on purpose doing something that you know is bad for you it's just training it to work and that's kind of shitty oh am i allowed to swear i don't know that's okay i did that's just regular speech and just stock in what are some other things they don't like well london it's a pretty great place i'm not loving the political situation in the uk more broadly right now brexit is a nasty situation and i don't love that um in terms of a favourite restaurant or cuisine and is it available in london i think there's so many good places to eat here and that is hugely important to me as a person who loves to eat lately i've been eating a lot of pizza last week i had pizza three times which feels so my excessive but that's okay i really like am not a restaurant but a bar the ridley road market bar in dulston has five pound pizzas and their delicious and their only five pounds and they have slushy cocktails and so you can have like a beautifully trashy night and the pizza is actually good i also really like ethiopian food which is easy to come by and really get indian food really love some some so some percoras anything deep fried yes have so many good places to eat and i've just moved and so i'm trying to like get to know the rest rounds around where i am which is really fine there's a twenty four hour bagel place which is great for a late night snack there's also a full awful place that seems to be open at all times so you know those late night snacks so important love it ah do i have any favourite parks i really love him said he because it's so big and beautiful and the views incredible and it also places to swim in it and that's really nice and i also really like i've just moved close to hackney downs and close to london fields and i really like those both just as sort of green spaces they're not as impressive as hampsaid heath but they are green and lundfields has a heated pool and that's something that i'm hoping to take advantage of uhm so that's cool if i was talking to someone who just moved here the things i would read|42
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_11.wav|what brings you to london i moved here to start in m press program at ucl previously in new york so that was a kind of a tough decision to leave the united states but i did want to get out of the net united states for sure but i i i mean i could have stayed i guess in new york and my job for one more year maybe see where that lead but that's what brings me here so i guess exploration but also mainly school what are some things i like about london i like like the program i like the relatively calmer pace of life compared to my situation in new york for sure i like that i'm not commuting two hours a day on the train i like yeah i like i like the apartment better sure yeah or some things you do not like public don't like that it rains every day a lot of days also don't like currently like the winter because it's dark out a lot which there is more son more more hours in the day light yeah yeah do you have a favorite restaurant christian so i love mexican food also love vietnamese food but so they have tripola here that's like my favorite restaurant in the states but it's a little different i'm not it's not worse or better but it's different got it a few times but i've been trying to eat more well i need to save money because i don't have as much sudden eating more home cooking meals i do feel like some of the food here is better quality though compared to like maybe the preservatives they put a lot of food in the states i don't know maybe that's a thing here i just notice that but interestingly i haven't really only had vietnamese food the far one time since i've moved here and i would get it like multiple times a week new york there's well i think it's interesting because there's a vietnamese place right across the street for me i still have not been there okay next question have you been to any of the parks yeah i've i just went to high park this past weekend which was very very nice i really like me my fiancee one and she loves nature and the animals is very nice seeing like go by the pond i really like that part and sing all like the geese they swans the huge swan and how they're just not really afraid of humans here it's nice symbiatic relationship they have where they get fat they can approach humans and take pictures and get fed really cool but as far as the part i so i've been to that park i've been doing one other part i can't remember the name i need to do more this is just generally i need to do more exploring of the city though i feel like during the semester i focus a lot on work and i've been off and i've had somewhat of a break and haven't really done exploring i don't know when i will i should be taking more advantage of that if you met someone new to the city what would you recommend they go to c or do i probably wouldn't be the best to our guide at this point i would just say like i i really like the area around picadilly circus i mean that it's probably pretty touristy but you could even just walk around there for a few hours and there's a lot to see i have to do depending whatever food you like can definitely find it in that area oh okay i know i i got a killed time but i want to go back up to what i don't|43
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_12.wav|yeah so i moved to london to start a master's degree at university college london that was two years ago i think maybe a little less i studied cognitive nearer science at the icn which is by russell square i really enjoyed the course it was about a year it was a year i didn't like being poor because i didn't have any income which wasn't great and which kind of makes living in london quite difficult but i did manage to get through the year since then i've stayed in london i actually got a job still with university college london as a research assistant which i am still doing now my contract runs out in september and it's been enjoyable so far i'm working with e g i feel like i can probably leave it about that things so i like there there's a lot of good music in london there are some jazz bands are active at the moment that i've seen a bunch of and i'm always learning new ones i don't know in the course of seeing you bands and hearing about people playing with second groups that also have projects their own i've been to some jazz jams i've really enjoyed and seen players there and gone to know people that i really enjoy this some good ones in hackney these one worry very close to our used to live in archway there's a really good night down in like portabello road which is quite good one there's probably some really good things in the south but i don't really know about it i never go to south london things only gracious i like i suppose i got a lot of friends in london because i come from the other white which is hideously boring if you're over the age of about four and you've got a q above twenty so a lot of my friends from the other white have you the moved here or they've moved to similar cities in the south of the uk i've also got some friends from university that came to the uk for university and then stayed here and now live in london as well so it's quite fun going seeing them one of them is dj so i've been come to see him play a few times another one another one i didn't see for a long time and he he was married but then they're getting a divorce but he moved back to london for a while so i kept in touch with him for a bit and he's been sent off to glasgow through his work so i only seem very rarely i'm gonna see very soon at new years so that'll be quite nice i'll leave on there i really don't like i suppose yeah the transport in london the fact that it takes ages to get places i kinda don't like the mentality of a lot of i think people that are native to the uk that have moved to london and kind of fallen in love with it and they don't quite realize or remember what it was like being in their home town where they didn't hear about london all the time so you get this kind of strange mindset where people think that everything's fine and there's so much going on without realizing how bad certain parts of the uk can be or how badly they're doing compared to london and it's it's a really weird kind of cognitive dissidence which it's it's something interesting that i don't really feel like i've heard a lot of my friends talk about i always find it quite strange that they just kind of seem to forget everything outside of london now the here seem i guess recently i've really eaten a lot of noodles it seems and there are tons of great place|44
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_13.wav|okay so what brings me to london while i've lived here for pretty much all my life i was born in japan but i came here when i was four years old so yeah i don't know what brought me to london but i've been here all my life and london's great i've i'm a i'm a big city boy i guess i've tried living well i mean i had to live in a smaller cisy oxford for my undergrad and that was a bit boring because that's not too much to do i think also coming from an asian community there's a bit more of like a like a japanese scene in london and so you have a bit more things to do with the japanese friends in london what else do i like about london i like that there are many people i think i feel most comfortable when there's there and there's loser people about example like when you're just walking through so ho or things like that and the evening you see those are people having fun that's logging around june flights and stuff yeah it's different from oxford for example like yeah doing the same and oxford just feels a bit smaller you don't feel has part of like a a big crowd or a big place yeah things i don't like about london that it's actually very hard to think about things i don't like about london and i guess things are expensive that's a pretty bad thing i guess and other things it's it's far from my from my home country which is japan it's like expensive to go to japan and yeah it takes a long time that's like a big time lag so it's hard to call family and so on there but generally yeah i bent a few places and i don't know if it's just because it's home but there's not too many things i don't like about london um yeah do i have ah so my favorite restaurant cuisine favorite restaurant is difficult question i don't like being asked what is my favorite of anything yeah same about cuisine but just to answer your question i'll give you a nice restaurant that i know of and that is one call gende in chinatown they do a really good hot pot help what's a great place to go with your friends that can be just one person that can be like ten people you can eat what you want to at the pace that you want and if you're feeling you know really up for a good time you can get for karaoke as well they have like private rooms and yeah places where you can get insurance with your friends favorite cuisine recently i've been enjoying tie i guess which is a little bit strange because i'm also trying to go on a spiceless diet yeah but maybe it's a bit of a guilty pleasure it's always one to have like a lot of spice in your feet the my favorite park i think must be height park i mean i guess i live near there so i have a strong bias but the the nice thing or one of the nice things about high park is that the run around the seven time which is the lake inside|45
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_14.wav|yeah so i've been in london for the past two years nobody i was in cambridge before that for year my wife's doing her phd at ucl in near signs she's at the s e n at queens square when we first moved here we moved to camped in town that was like a student housing it was okay it was cheap and big was really big for london in central kind of grimy that had an awful blue carpet but it wasn't a huge deal and we had no control over the heat so was freezing cold in the winter time and they were undergrads above us and around us it wasn't a huge deal but it was weird we could hear in the bathroom the undergrads partying in the kitchen above us but it was strange because you could only really hear it in the bathroom so we'd be sleeping in a bedroom in silence we'd go to the bathroom and it would be like this party club just funny anyway the kick us out of there we moved to a couple of other places since then we were in kentuchtown which was cool well it was okay we paid thirteen hundred pounds a month it was way too much and it's like a tiny place there are these awful people above us that were really obnoxious and loud uhm but yeah and that in the house it was really small the bathroom was tiny in the toilet was disgusting we had a one year lease but we broke it basically to say the upstream people are intolerable and then we move to high gate to which where we are now and it's equally small but it's way cheaper saving like three hundred fifty pounds a month which is amazing and it's a quieter area it's nice i read my bike to work so it's not a huge deal i guess in terms of the community i like london there's a something to do in london and you can just for like walk in random directions there's less you can enjoy i mean like on a day off not have to think like what should i do today in my small town you don't have to spend a lot of money in london to have a nice time you can walk round and see a lot of amazing things even though obviously can spend a lot of money in london i like the history of it i like the people like the diversity people are really kind um yeah it's sort of like dead down to earth i find except for the parts that are completely not down to earth i guess there's just a lot of extremity in london and i like all the burrows i like all the like diversity not noticing the people but in the feelings of the different burrows where you kind of feel it london feels like a lot of small towns kind of squish together um which i find really cool because you can get lots of different vibes trending if you're wanting something more kind of quaint and cozy or something more you know business corporate or something more um exciting night club greedy whatever you want that's there um that what i don't like about london i mean everyone talk about the pollution thank god for city con in the mayor and the his merrill staff who are trying to do something about it i actually read to day i think that lends actually having its first zero emissions street which means that it's it's not pedestrianized which is what immediately thought it's it's a street for cars but they have to be electric vehicles or vehicles that don't have any emissions so basically as you're driving up to the street there's all these signs being like don't come down here if you're a polluter i'm not really sure what happens if you drive down it and you don't have an electric vehicle whether they're all like puppy finds or why but anyway i think that's cool but yet the pollution's gross um i don't i like about london commuting the tube speaking of pollution what's going on with the tube i mean we live it's like the twenty first century and like the most polluted thing ever i mean for first world i guess i guess it's a privilege thing to say|46
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_15.wav|so the great perimeter of geeze a bit made me think about churches and and which i hate going in them and when i read here that people might have been even paired for bearing building the pyramid i thought **** that when you going churches all you know is that people were forced to build them and that was supposed to like them and that the emblems of the most corrupt organization in the world ever and i even hit the smell of them and because when i was younger was top by nuns and forced to go to church every sunday and even serve on the ultra at seven o'clock in the morning one week a month i've never quite forgiven churches and i even hit the smell of them when i read about william herschel i thought we always concentrate on what people did that that worked similarly with newton we construct what he got right but he was also in not case and he worked on alchemy and tried to turn led into gold but hershel's bit of nuttery was that he actually believed that there were people who were living on the moon and he held quite strongly for a long period of his life to the belief that he had seen evidence of structures like trees and i can't remember the buildings but other things on the moon that proved that there were people people who who lived there same is true for line is pauling who won i think he wanted two mobile prizes one of chemistry monfa one for biology was in a race with watson and cricket for dna but he in later life had this mad naution that if you took loads and loads and lots of vitamin sea it would a bet cancer and cos i like to try things out i did that at one time and all it does is make you go to the bathroom and off a lot the north wind and the sun made me think of something that i've pieced music that i've been writing which he's actually called the north wind and i i wrote it for the impending death of one of my friends grandmothers um that's what that made me think of and the poetry made me think of nearer science there's an owner project i want to get one of my undergraduates to do which is can't remember the lab it came from but there's a great purpose showing how language are different words are maps in different in semantic structures in the brown and i have a hypothesis that if you take a top one hundred of shared spears metaphors and almost anybody else's cause he's ruined it for everybody else that the distance in these maps between shakespeare's matter metaphorical images the the the the things that he uses and other peoples will be greater and that one of the things that make seem so great is that he does actually stretch things across the he makes us travel greater distances in our brain the other thing that the point made me think of is about going to bed by dare because i'm i'm an obitual napper this morning go to meet a friend for breakfast at ten o'clock she lives an hour away i live ten minutes away and i was fifteen minutes late for a ten o'clock breakfast because i really can't do do mornings and i do go spend every day even if i come into the icn i'll i'll go home for a nap in the afternoon and in my office i used to have a bed and i removed it because too many people in the i c m were taking naps in my office and it begun to smell and um the second point didn't make me think of anything at all actually so i i i have nothing to say about that one counting from one to forty strangely made me think about brian butter with cause he works on numerical numerical cognition and he was one of the people who got me to be interested in how the brain processes numbers so that was what one to forty made me think of and then i started to get nervous cause i thought all gosh what if the next test is kind of harder and i have to count backwards in sevens and and|47
data/INTERSPEECH_UCL/train_16.wav|um so i'm gonna talk about my favorite subject which is london i was born in london in london bridge so i'm one of the few er real londoness and your note assist at christmas when a london's empty because everybody goes back to the sorry or whether they're from and they leave london to the real london and so it's the best time to go out drink here or go to a restaurant and stuff with his is now in around erm over christmas we normally go to a pub in charing cross road and it's wondered only ones at home open between christmas and new year and it's they have a great dreg show there and so we normally go there and then we go to the waffle shop after in a near old content street and out of waffles and stuff but um i've lived in london my whole life and it's my favorite place in the world er even though i'm a bit biased um one of the things that love about it is even during this time of er its populism and right when we still kind of liberal and we celebrate difference and we celebrate different cultures and foods and music and people and places and stuff at that and that's one of the reasons why i'm so proud of being from london erm my firmly have lived in the same area for about three hundred years we can trace back erm and unfortunately i'm the last person of my family to live in the year or so unless i have children that would be our family named stead erm in that error she is quite sad and but still live i live in the burmans ear of london which was when i was a kid it was still quite a post industrial there was empty factories and it was kind of run down there wasn't much development and it was kind of dark and run down but in some ways are still i missed that and it's quite interesting that we're nostalgic about the things that we that were quite bad for us it's changed quite a lot in the recent times there's no buildings and coffee shops and new people that is hard to not fill it as lost it so in er some way and i think is the double edge sort out i like that there's no development but i just wish that they would leave some of the stuff for the people that live ran as the lawn drets and the pubs and stuff like that the kind of were the social places of the area that kind of er a disappearing now erm i've lived in lots of places all over the world but have always kept my flat in london so that i can come home whenever i want lived in new york for a bit which was kind of like london on the steroids but super neurotic city people shown each other lived in sydney for a bit melbourne south africa south america have lived in africa for little bits of time erm but there's no place like london so i'd like to stay you so if i can when i'll finish my phd because a i don't really want to move away and seems to be a common problem in academia is that there's fearing a few of jobs as the academics work into whirling to their eighties and stuff then for the young people coming up there's less than this jobs in research and especially jobs in london and academics are forced to move all over the world to get work so er not really short a solution is when i'm trauma best to stay in london for that er the icing that he's got lots of interest in people and do an interest in project's mind project his erm about what happens to your sleep structure when you lose your vision erm so there's different i diseases affect different parts of the iresome diseases affect the image forming layers of the eye other other diseases affect the the retinal gangling there which which is the rest in place for these certain class of cells which tell the brain when it's daytimer when it's night time and in certain blind pages|48
