the %HESITATION minister mile and I've lived in London my whole life my favorite thing about London %HESITATION the museums and off the %HESITATION community centers and all of the activities that you can the around that little pubs and the clubs I guess %HESITATION my favorite area would be south Kensington %HESITATION around that knight's bridge to have lots of I'm nice European food last autumn they have a Taco Bell the things that you don't really get enough of places in London I guess compared to where I live %HESITATION that is not possible that I have %HESITATION you have the bikes in London that there isn't much in those rural areas as well but they're a stop sign to be fell out and I guess my favorite restaurant I'm used to be nine dollars spot is now more %HESITATION I do like about faith that there is a quite in in my neighborhood so they serve with different types of foods that they serve pizza and that my favorite food would be %HESITATION Indian food to be honest about curry so it would be the curry and the chicken and lamb and the different types of Rustan's this book this blessed that they have which I do nothing of the names as they have details and stuff and stuff %HESITATION those that pump for them which is something that is not nice which because of the Indian PM my favorite fruit and you have a I guess in London there isn't really too many Indian places that all right %HESITATION would go to you eight and so %HESITATION my favorite places will be close to my home in that regards and %HESITATION I guess I went to university in London and so what I'll stay out of that and impairing south Kensington so the son of a reason why south and is a favorite area over one and then we have the %HESITATION of the Vietnam medicine thought when I was studying medicine I am only done basically the first year and so now I decided to you what K. still in London but %HESITATION you know also is interested in research what was I mean I was interested in research about becoming a therapist a psychiatrist but I guess I was with we can not you know I wasn't really into that the surgical aspects of medicine without we will still have to do every every Vancouver Island calls but I was really into kinda but isn't there and someone asks us awful often find a different path and I have to fill out a lock on it would be easy for me to start working out maybe go back to university their own and so I'm I'm not going to improve we'll see that lots of %HESITATION different courses that they offer similar things I guess I'll with you want to stay in London and faculty universitas %HESITATION %HESITATION I guess but the idea of going to a place outside of London to like a more rural area wouldn't be too and pass information I guess I have %HESITATION most of my school and earlier on done in a more rooms than than %HESITATION then on Wednesday and was there a lack the fact that in the loss of different places different types of restaurants and stuff like that and %HESITATION I guess what in London the best the best things usually I kind of just like in the send off to where you know when they have a different museums lacking the lessons as well I'd recommend %HESITATION put that out to you maybe that science museums and let the art museums
