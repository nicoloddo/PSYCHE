sign me to London just over a year ago now test auto pay stock job at UCL I'm I guess I applied for a few different jobs and this is the one I got I honestly wasn't sure about moving to London because whenever I'd been had before it was often seen quite big and intimidating and you know when you get the cheap and then you come out of the jeep you have no idea what direction you're facing or will exit you should go out of %HESITATION and you have to start looking for Google maps leaving kind of catch up and tell you which option you're going in that was kind of my experience in London of being disoriented and lost and I don't think it really helps that I spent a lot of time in the slightly like less nice parts of London some of my friends moved to after we finished undergraduate %HESITATION and oversee nobody had any money and a lot of them are still doing for the study and stuff so they kind of left in miles away parts of London %HESITATION like I guess Berman C. Ole at shepherd's bush market and stuff and so it's been a lot of time traveling just to get from one place to another will you go out with some friends and then you have to get like four night buses back %HESITATION to someone's slot where you could stay for the night or waiting for the bus %HESITATION but %HESITATION said while sitting at a time as of three o'clock in the morning from like Notting hill %HESITATION I'm not kind of intimidating and so I think I always got this impression of London is kind of quite cold and unfriendly %HESITATION it'll say somewhere where it's really inconvenient to anyway but I think that she just at the time all of the people I knew lived in inconvenient places and well I guess it's obviously makes sense when you consider that students but Mr London's not ready like that there are parts of London even though they're cheap and are also a lot nicer and easier to get around to Mars I would not say west London is particularly always like that I'm I think some of the things I like mace Wellington adjusted as always something going on %HESITATION does always like a museum or an art gallery or show you the final scene %HESITATION and it's kind of nice to be able to wake up one morning and not have any plans in particular what you want to stay but still be able to find something really interesting that you'll really enjoy and not touch upon it weeks or months in advance or for it to be like the same thing they've done and seen the full and suddenly things are a delight it also kind of like how I see more of my family than the folks they come from a London say that able to visit me off me more often %HESITATION although it does mean that my younger sister kind of tends to turn off and it's like oh by the way can I stay with you tonight and I'm like yes %HESITATION but maybe someone would have been helpful %HESITATION yeah but I mean I guess she's kind of at that point in her life where she's just experimenting and visiting friends and forward planning isn't as important to her %HESITATION but it is nice even when she just turned up unexpectedly even if it's been stressful to like find someone had to sleep on like %HESITATION and I make sure she gets what I've trained you need the next morning it is nice that she feels that she can just turn off and be welcome and %HESITATION I think some things I don't really like Valentina %HESITATION how police today is I mean you can't call reset when I think about who fell in the face of it but every so often you have these like news BBC news articles or whatever come out that say those like most pleased to pick places in the city %HESITATION brings race pretty bad to central London's pre bought the troops raided pot %HESITATION and while she can't see the effect it has on your health you kind of worry that maybe is %HESITATION maybe it will a few years down the line %HESITATION some of my family has lost most so it's kind of always a bit of a concern
