I come to London this semester to study abroad. um, I go to a small liberal arts school, um, in Maine, in the Us. um, and was looking to have a completely different experience this semester after having fouranda, uh, half semesters at baits. um, I think it's awesome to go to a large university with a ton of research sources, like what I'm doing right now, um, and to be in a large city, um, whereas lewiston, where bates is a city, it's actually the second largest metropolitan area in Maine. um, it's not saying much, uh, because it is Maine, so it's awesome to be surrounded by such culture in, um, London. um, also, um, the psychology department, um, is world, ah, renowned at ucl, um, and it's the epicenter of theater, uh, in London. um, my two, uh, interests, um, there are tons of things I like about London. I love that it's a very international place. um, during our student, uh, orientation, we learned that most people who, uh, come to London or who live in London actually came here and weren't born here. And so there, uh, must be an incredible diversity, not just of, uh, races, uh, ethnicities, um, but also of backgrounds, uh, histories, passions, um, experiences, some things that I don't like about London. um, it's definitely been, ah, a lot of rain, uh, and I think I was expecting that, though, so it's not a huge downer. um, but it was a little drizzly coming here, uh, today, actually. um, but sometimes a rain is nice. I like when a rain is mixed in, uh, to a normal sunny week. It kind of mixes it up, I think. So far, my favorite restaurant that I've gone to is probably I've been making a lot of my dinners that I've been going out to lunch, and I had a really nice sandwich at Planet Organic roast vegetables and hummus sandwich because I'm a vegetarian, and so it was really delicious. I, um, liked it a lot. So I really don't want to fall into the trap of spending $10 or £10 on a sandwich and a smoothie every day, uh, especially because Plant Organic is right on campus and it's so tempting to go to. um, I have not been to any of major parks, uh, yet in London. My dorm, schaefer, uh, house, um, which is a ucl dorm, and it's right by regents Park. um, and so I'm really looking forward to exploring that. I love animals a lot, and so I'm looking forward to going to the London Zoo in regents Park as well. um, I'm in an architecture class, um, this term at ucl. um, and we actually have one class that's about the buildings of the London Zoo. And so I'm looking forward to checking those out. And so, I guess, hopefully, I'll be that's, like in week seven, uh, or something of the term. So, hopefully I'll have been to regents Park already, but the square right outside of this building. I got here a little early, so I walked around a little, and it was really beautiful. I think it was Queen Square. um, I've noticed in London there are a bunch of really beautiful little green spaces that kind of, uh, covered the city. And I think that's really special and really makes the city aesthetic. If I met someone new to the city, what would you recommend them go to see or do? With my vast knowledge of, uh, London, uh, that I've amassed in the last week, I would say, um, go to camden Market. I think that was my favorite day that I've had had some really good food, kind of got a sense of London, um, walked around a lot, um, and met some cool, uh, ucl people was right after the psychology, uh, affiliate info session. um, I definitely would recommend that, um, to someone, but it is really easy to get lost. uh, my friend Brian and.
