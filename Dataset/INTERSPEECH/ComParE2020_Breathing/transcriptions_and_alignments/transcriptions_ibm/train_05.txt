um i was born in london i have been in west london for all of my life of twenty seven now i was born in hillington hospital in hounds low which is in west london and it is on one end of the piccadilly line near to heathrow airport some of the things i like about london are that is very easy to get around erm you can meet lots of different people from all around the world and try a lot of different things particularly food music travelling is very easy from here what are there some of the things i don't like that london it's very crowded i don't do well in crowds it can be really grilling me especially in the winter which seems to last for about nine months of the year it rains a lot also i don't like that it's quite great in terms of even the buildings and the pavements and everything is great except in the summer it's fine the one thing that is good though is that you can easily get to green spaces apparently there are so many trees in london that it would actually officially be counted as a forest but obviously they're not all in the same place so it doesn't always feel like that do i have a favorite rest wrong i like i'm not sure actually mm-hmm mm mm mm have i been to any of the parks in london and do i have a favorite park yes i do it's actually not one of the big ones my favorite park is ostelli park which again is in west london where i live it's you can get to that on the big dilly liners or if you suppose delete station but it's one of their national trust properties and it's a bit of the way so doesn't get a lot of people going there but it's got a big house really big grounds used to belong to a family who i think owned most of that area but they've just turned the park bit of it international trust property then it's got a lake and a river and you can go canoeing on the river and they have like swans and ducks they also have rabbits and if you go doing by the end of march beginning of april you can usually see baby ducks and baby rabbits um so it's really nice they also have cows horses to gives because they have a small working farm on the park so it's quite fun if someone was new to the city i would say probably go and see the parks because they're a good escape from the general hustling bustle and sometimes you need a break from that i'd say do all the touristy things because some of them are quite fine and i think especially if you live here and you've been here a long time you do miss out and doing this we also have lots of nice museums and you can usually spend an entire day walking around one museum one particular thing that i like doing is every year they have the national photographer the nature photographer of the year and they present all the pictures in the natural history museum and that's always good to go and see i haven't really been to any of the tourist attractions like the land and i we went on school trips so i've been to like madam to swords and the london dungeons and stuff like that um generally i'd they are probably overrated i like more than nature stuff and parks and things like that and also going round museums at my own pace other things to do in london would include i think one thing that i'm interested in doing is just going to random stations because sometimes when you're on a line so for example i take the big dealer line every single day to work but i only go up to certain point and i always wonder what is the rest
