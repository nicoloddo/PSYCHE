what brings me to london well i live in london so i have lived in london for most of my life it's most probably the favor my most favourite place in the world even though i have travelled been to other places but it's always london that that calls you back what are some of the things i like about london well i i like that it so varied there's so many different things to do in london so many different types of people yeah what are some of the things i don't like about london well it rains a lot it's quite cold it can get quite busy like there's there's a lot of people around it's one of the major cities of the world so there's obviously lots of tourism that's attracted to to london which is not necessarily a bad thing but i think when you're a london a and you're just trying to get around it can be quite difficult especially in the holiday seasons my favorite do i have a favorite i don't really have a favorite restaurant but my favorite type of cuisine is probably turkish food or anything that's like grilled meat so yes kind of like middle eastern mediterranean style food it's yeah it's very widely available in london puts particularly in in certain areas of central london like eduar road or places like that or night spring yeah so turkish food is is very tasty making me hungry right now even think king about it i have i've been to any parks in london and didn't do i have a favorite park i have been to pretty much most of the parks in london don't really have a favorite one but if i had to pick i would say regions park because it's in a really good location having said that so is hide park the both in really good locations depending on on what other things you want to do other than just going to a park and within the parts obviously there's other the there's sort of activities that you can do like boat riding etc stuff like that so it's it's pretty cool it's it's quite fun especially on a summer's day few mets if i if i met someone new to the city what would i recommend they go and see r this is a good one i think one of the things i really enjoy doing in london even though i might have done it more than once is visiting the museums in in south kensington and i would really recommend if somebody was new to the city to go and visit like the natural history museum and victory and i'll but museum i just think there's so much to see and so much to learn and when when you're a kind of a londonest from birth pretty much and you have schooled in london you visited these museums as a child but as an adult it's just there's just so much more value to actually going there and taking it all in the question have you been to any tourist attractions for example the ones i did you enjoy it was overheated i i have been of i've been a tourist in my own town
