um so i'm gonna talk about my favorite subject which is london i was born in london in london bridge so i'm one of the few er real londoness and your note assist at christmas when a london's empty because everybody goes back to the sorry or whether they're from and they leave london to the real london and so it's the best time to go out drink here or go to a restaurant and stuff with his is now in around erm over christmas we normally go to a pub in charing cross road and it's wondered only ones at home open between christmas and new year and it's they have a great dreg show there and so we normally go there and then we go to the waffle shop after in a near old content street and out of waffles and stuff but um i've lived in london my whole life and it's my favorite place in the world er even though i'm a bit biased um one of the things that love about it is even during this time of er its populism and right when we still kind of liberal and we celebrate difference and we celebrate different cultures and foods and music and people and places and stuff at that and that's one of the reasons why i'm so proud of being from london erm my firmly have lived in the same area for about three hundred years we can trace back erm and unfortunately i'm the last person of my family to live in the year or so unless i have children that would be our family named stead erm in that error she is quite sad and but still live i live in the burmans ear of london which was when i was a kid it was still quite a post industrial there was empty factories and it was kind of run down there wasn't much development and it was kind of dark and run down but in some ways are still i missed that and it's quite interesting that we're nostalgic about the things that we that were quite bad for us it's changed quite a lot in the recent times there's no buildings and coffee shops and new people that is hard to not fill it as lost it so in er some way and i think is the double edge sort out i like that there's no development but i just wish that they would leave some of the stuff for the people that live ran as the lawn drets and the pubs and stuff like that the kind of were the social places of the area that kind of er a disappearing now erm i've lived in lots of places all over the world but have always kept my flat in london so that i can come home whenever i want lived in new york for a bit which was kind of like london on the steroids but super neurotic city people shown each other lived in sydney for a bit melbourne south africa south america have lived in africa for little bits of time erm but there's no place like london so i'd like to stay you so if i can when i'll finish my phd because a i don't really want to move away and seems to be a common problem in academia is that there's fearing a few of jobs as the academics work into whirling to their eighties and stuff then for the young people coming up there's less than this jobs in research and especially jobs in london and academics are forced to move all over the world to get work so er not really short a solution is when i'm trauma best to stay in london for that er the icing that he's got lots of interest in people and do an interest in project's mind project his erm about what happens to your sleep structure when you lose your vision erm so there's different i diseases affect different parts of the iresome diseases affect the image forming layers of the eye other other diseases affect the the retinal gangling there which which is the rest in place for these certain class of cells which tell the brain when it's daytimer when it's night time and in certain blind pages
