so i come from singapore and i came over to london to pursue my undergraduate studies before up i've lived and even though i'm singapore and i've also lived in china and south korea and as well as before i came over to london i studied psychology and anger signs and i'm ends currently in my thought yeah so upon graduation i hope to pursue mse and developmental psychology either at ucl or at kings and i hope to be developmental or child psychologists so i really some of my hobbies include running as well as traveling i recently came back from germany and japan i have some family in japan so i go to japan almost every year at least once a year i the favorite country that i've been to so far i would say or rather the favorite city that i like thus far i think it was to be like tokyo because i like how efficient it is i like how transport there is so much more convenient and i like how everything opens up to really late at night so i can still like get fruit read a hang out my friends really late yeah some of the other countries that i really enjoyed visiting includes greece marias melbourne which i guess australia and indian bali in indonesia i think that's because i really like the beach and i really like the c r i to go south body so that's why i guess i really like countries with beaches and like the sea side in general i hope to like stay in london for another two us and the potentially move to canada or back to south carolina ones lived i want to let move to kind of good canada because i really like cold wind tests and i really like the snow and i just like being around natura so that is one of my effect the big reasons why i want to move that i think london might get a bit too busy for me sometimes so and there's a lot of people so that's why i might not generally were one of the few in a long time south korea so another option for me because i live there for really long and a lot of my friends at that so and i think i'm also really used to the country so that's also another reason why i think i might want to move back to south korea after living in london but that said i really like london a lot i like how diversities i like how i can meet so many different people off coming from so many different backgrounds and i like how it's also really close to europe i think if i had not come to london to pursue undergraduate studies i don't think i would have
