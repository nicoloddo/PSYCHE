i come to london this semester to study abroad i go to a small liberal art school in maine in the u s and was looking to have a completely different experience the semester after having four and a half semesters at bates i think it's awesome to go to a large university the ton of resources like what i'm doing right now and to be in a large city whereas louis bates is a city it's actually the second largest metropolitan area in maine it's not saying much because it is made so it's awesome to be surrounded by such culture i'm in london i'm also my that the psychology department is world renowned at ucl and it's the at the center theater in london my two interests there tom things i like i love that it's a very international place during our student orientation like learned that most people who come to london or who live in london actually came here and weren't born here and so there must be incredible diversity not just of races ethnicities but also of backgrounds histories passions experiences some things i don't like about london it's definitely been a lot of rain and i think i was expecting that though so it's not a huge downer but it was a little trickly coming here today actually but sometimes it rain is nice i like when a rain is mixed in to a normal sunny week kind of mixes it up i think so far my favorite restaurant that i've gone to is probably i've been making a lot of my dinners but i've been going out to launch and i'd really nice sandwich at planet organic roast vegetables and humans sandwich because i'm a vegetarian and so it it was really really delicious i liked it a lot so i really don't want to fall into the trap of spending ten dollars or ten pounds on a sandwich and smoothly every day especially because plan organic is right on campus and is so tempting to go to i have not been to any of the major parks yet in london my dorm shape house which is the ucl dorm i mean it's right by regions park and so i'm really looking forward to exploring that i love animals a lot i'm looking forward to going to the one zoo in regions park as well i'm in architecture class this term you see and we actually have one class that's about the buildings of the the london zoo and so i'm looking forward to checking those out and so i guess that'll hopefully i'll be that that's like in week seven or something of the term so hopefully i'll have been to regions park already but the square right outside of this building i got here a little early so i walked around a little and it was really beautiful i think squeen square is i've noticed in mind in their bunch of really beautiful little green spaces that kind of covered the city and i think that's really special and remakes the city aesthetic if i met someone new in to the city what would you recommend them to go to see or do with my fast knowledge of london that i've a mast in the last week i would say go to camden market that i think i was my favorite day that i've had had some really good food kind of got a sense of london walked around a lot and met some cool you see all people was right after the psychology affiliate info session and so i definitely would recommend that to someone but it is really easy to get lost my friend brian and i
