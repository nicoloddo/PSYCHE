so i moved to london i guess two and a half years ago and i moved here with my partner at the time who was doing a masters and music at the royal academy of music studying violent performance um and since then i have gotten a job at the british library and that i guess is what keeps me in london um because i like my job and i like being here some of the things that i like about london i love how much is going on culturally i think there's just so much to do at all times um which is really valuable i think it's really cool that if you want to see a play there's not like i come from a smaller city in there maybe you want to see a play you've got two options max here i don't know there's like thirty things you could go and see just looking at theater never mind looking at dance or music or like opera or ballet or anything really there's just so many options and i love that i also love how like culturally diverse it is and i think that really contributes to really strong cuisine there's just food from all over the worlds and i love eating and so that's really nice and i lake a lot of the parks in london i think that there's a surprising amount of green space for a city of this size and i also think the architecture is really beautiful and really diverse i think there's some really interesting brutalism um and there's also just like beautiful victorian homes so many beautiful victorian homes some of the things i don't like about london would be the pollution um think you can feel that the cities bad for your health and that's not something that i'm used to and i don't love that they say that if you take the two before an hour its equivalent to smoking a cigarette and that's like just a way of getting around that's not even on purpose doing something that you know is bad for you it's just training it to work and that's kind of shitty oh am i allowed to swear i don't know that's okay i did that's just regular speech and just stock in what are some other things they don't like well london it's a pretty great place i'm not loving the political situation in the uh uk more broadly right now brexit is a nasty situation and i don't love that um in terms of a favourite restaurant or cuisine and is it available in london i think there's so many good places to eat here and that is hugely important to me as a person who loves to eat lately i've been eating a lot of pizza last week i had pizza three times which feels so my excessive but that's okay i really like am not a restaurant but a bar the ridley road market bar in dulston has five pound pizzas and their delicious and their only five pounds and they have slushy cocktails and so you can have like a beautifully trashy night and the pizza is actually good um i also really like ethiopian food which is easy to come by and really get indian food really love some some so some percoras anything deep fried yes have so many good places to eat and i've just moved and so i'm trying to like get to know the rest rounds around where i am which is really fine there's a twenty four hour bagel place which is great for a late night snack um there's also a full awful place that seems to be open at all times so you know those late night snacks so important love it ah do i have any favourite parks i really love him said he uh because it's so big and beautiful and the views incredible and it also places to swim in it and that's really nice and i also really like um i've just moved close to hackney downs and close to london fields and i really like those both just as sort of green spaces they're not as impressive as hampsaid heath uh uh but they are green and uh lundfields has a heated pool and that's uh something that i'm hoping to take advantage of uhm so that's cool if i was talking to someone who just moved here the things i would read
