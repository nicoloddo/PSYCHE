so i came to london first uh in nineteen ninety two after uh i had finished my phd oxford and i was looking for a permanent job i started first working at an institution called london guilt all uh university uh which later became london match policy university i started first as a very junior electra and left london metropolitan in nineteen ninety two as a senior uh member of the faculty of life sciences i started working at uh ucl in september two thousand and twelve and i'm currently faculty teacher for brain sciences so what brought me to london initially and indeed has a maintained mystery london has been my work uh which has been at two higher education institutions both really quite different and um both located in different places i enjoyed working at london uh mats it was a trial by fire to some extent it was a post uh ninety two university with some challenging widening participation and student achievement issues and limited resources but that made me quite creative and inventive er in in carrying out interventions to support an enhanced student experience without very much financial resources coming to ucl has been great because it is well class university the calibra's uh teenance is very different and more importantly there is financial support and resources and um an organisation that uh enables you to be creative on lots of lots of projects to enhance our overall students uh experience so i have uh lived in london uh uh quite a uh number of years now i never intended to live in london but i just went where the employment was however i have come to really really like londonon are uh the great things i love about london are uh the people in terms of the ethnic diversity our uh um people live here from many different countries and uh have many different uh ethnicities and is very diverse culturally i love the parks in london i love the the art uh galleries and the museums which are free and i love being in the capital and i miss it when i visit other places having travelled a lot to many other countries uh i still like being british and i like being in london some of the things that i don't like about london or the travel uh the underground is really under uh resourced its pact i uh live on the northern line it's called the misery line for a very good reason and having visited other countries such as hong kong and shanghai and beijing where they also have metro systems i can see that they have taken they come and looked at the london underground system and thought we're not gonna do it like that so i know that it is possible to have better uh metro systems the other thing i don't like about london is the expense it's much more expensive to live here than is in many other parts of the country or uh indeed any other part of uh the country i don't have a favourite restaurant um or cuisine because one of the great things about london is the diversity of uh food that you can eat here i uh particularly like chinese food i particularly like fish and shell fish and there is a plethora of places to to visit and food to uh eat and i don't particularly have a favourite place i uh love the parks in london and my uh favourite park is probably uh uh clap on common uh followed by saint jeans's park followed by richmond park club and common is very close to where i live and i visit it frequently uh almost every week and it changes doing the course of the seasons so at the moment
