uhm even though i sort of live in london them always more in the central power of london rather than the outskirts of it i find it more um like vibrant small five fast paste there's a lot of things to do there's a lot of shops there's a lot of places to go a little uh uh soft beat sort of like back rows with quirky little shops and stools that you're unaware of um it was feels that you've sort of seen the whole of london but you haven't this is why i'd like to sort of keep coming back and having a look about i like the different shops now the food shops are still to come up there's all different ones like more um street the ones more from say you got i don't know something um from thailand or uh spain but it's small the ones that you wouldn't get over here that aside to uh come up and it will uh pop up sort of shops and stools that uh are from really nice different foods that are very sort of um sort uh of unheard of or you've seen them this sort of not been put in a state mixture of the way that you sort of uh think um things that i don't really uh uh like about london although i do like it uh is the fast pace cause although it is fast place and it's good never thinks on the go go go uh uh sometimes you can get into this sort of lightless uh uh boverage no it's too much yours to uh uh overcrail did it's uh bumping in the road uh um london transport gets too much so sh when you've like finished work you gotta uh get the uh tube so yeah london uh transport although it's good as well it serves its uh uh purpose but other uh times it can just be a bit but of an annoyance until you get like a clear carriage or clear bars uh uh at the clear lane for it to go down it's brilliant um there's lots of uh restaurants as well round in london um it is different ones but i think i like um uh place called uh like benny harner uh where the chef sort of comes to your table cooks a food up in front of you i think that's really good it's different but uhm i think it's been around for a while but and you got introduced to it myself not too long ago i uh like the new little doughnut uh stools and shops that are open and that uh start to take over uh and the nice health shops are sort of coming up that i sort of basically be the inflict now and everyone's trying to eat clean and live better so uh it is more shops are appearing that i'll serve in that so there's place called crosstowns um yeah they do these sort of donuts are uh quite huge and size um very nice my favorite ones the settlement uhm silver uh scroll so it's a doubt number is like a uh cinnamon sort uh of pastry sort of thing that is like a combined one but yeah it's very nice and then um there's loads of parks as well um to go about m hyde parks really good sometimes they have a like once a year big winter wonderland over there and it's really really big and it sort of uh covers the whole of that fill they have over there available urm lazer things to do loads of rides loads of stools offering different quirky things lows of uh people um it's just a very fibrant sort of uh uh fun place to be night times better as well because it's got more of a sort of facts or uh edge to receive uh the lights you see you get more fulfilled entertainment fill from it uhm but i think you should when you come to london is visit say cabdon though a nice camera um uh uh uh uh uh market as all golly source it will quirk a little uh back areas and little allies uh and bacselves street shops and markets and what not brick lanes another one
