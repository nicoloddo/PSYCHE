what brings me to london is that i live here and i've lived here for about twenty five years i work here and i've lived in north london in the same place for about ten years things i like about london are the multiculturalism the um vast expanse of buildings and parks and also the fact that it has a great historical and uh architectural rich environment in which you can walk around free of charge and see the many great buildings that are here some things i don't like about london are the fact that it's so overcrowded seems that everywhere you go there are people every time of the day twenty four hours seven days a week sometimes you just can't escape the fact that there are so many people around there's a lot of traffic in london and a lot of people using public transport you feel like you're fighting for space all the time i do have a favourite restaurant and it serves english cuisine but the inside of the restaurant is decorated in all church furniture it's based in kilbern in north london and you may be sitting on a old pue from a church while you eating um being served wine from a challence or you may be sitting staring at a uh pulpit with no minister in it the food is very good and it's not very expensive it's always quite a busy place i have been to all the parks in london but i think my favourite park is hide park i like the fact that it has a lake and you can actually take a boat onto the lake and row around in the summer time it also has a really nice calf way called the cerpain time which is on the edge of the uh lake and you can sit outside all times of year have a coffee and what's the swans on the ducks gliding past it's always uh popular with tourists and hide park is one of the royal parks in london of which there are five but i particularly like it because it's right buying in the center but you also feel that you're not in london when you're walking around it it has got a very interesting italian um garden on the north side near bluster uh place um which was designed in the night early nineteenth century it has a pagoda and uh some fountains which make it a really nice place to chilite some of the other places in hide park which are quite interesting are the peter pan statue and also speaker's corner where an ancient uh law alloys people to stand up and say things even with our uh offence of now days but without uh getting arrested so it has the only place in london left where you have freedom of speech and you can discuss any subject you want without being arrested if i met someone new in the city what would i recommend they go and see i think probably my favourite landmark in london is tower bridge i'm always in all of the side of its structure and the fact that it is a bridge with actually opens up uh to allow uh boats and ships to go through the center of it i've often marvelled at the engineering and the fact that was built over two hundred and fifty years ago uh shows that the people that were round then are obviously very intelligent and they built something that really has lasted the test of time um the area around tower bridge is also very interesting because it used to be the old uh docs of london where all the ships the spices came in from the west india trading company uh some of the buildings you can still smell the spices
