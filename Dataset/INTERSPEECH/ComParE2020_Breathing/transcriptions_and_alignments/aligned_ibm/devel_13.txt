so what brings you to london um i came to london to go to university and study psychology and language sciences at ucl erm uh um but after about a term i realize this course wasn't really for me so actually i'm dropping out a link uh i'm going to uh change course i am hoping to study fine out at uh ucl again in september twenty twenty some of the things i like about london are how much cultured it is and how big it is and how busy it is all the time cause i came from a very small town in wales good morning and it's very different from here some of the things i do not like about london it's probably uh uh the pollution and how loud is every night cause im not used to that and i fall asleep very lightly and i wake up very easily and the accommodation is so hot they have to uh open the window every night hmm and every night without fail i hit ambulances and police sirens and it's just very sad favorite restaurant or cussy in erm um i would say my favourite cuisine is probably asian because it's very homely to me and my family has used to cook food from hong kong at this favorite dish made from overseen i don't know the english translation but it takes very very good even though it smells a bit funky ermh favorite restaurant at the moment i don't really have a favorite restaurant but i did hear that rotty king near uh euston station is very good so i'll probably go visit that seem for some rotty as well as for their atmosphere i like japanese food but a lot of the more budget and see she is not that great uh which is kind of sad but i do enjoy making sushi with my flat mates um that's quite entertaining even if we can't roll uh out properly most of the time and it doesn't always taste great because most of them are vegan and we can't put a fish in it or anything have i been to any of the parks in london do i have a favorite park hmmm i went to hide park with my course mate last term um which is very fun we bought uh step from our accommodation which was probably about a thirty uh five minute to forty minute walk which is not that bad but as quotes and uh exercise and then we had to walk further into hide part to get to surf the seventeen i think that's the lake there uh it was really chill dake is it was autumn and all the leaves were still to come down and was uh quite pretty erm oh i heard uh that er no it wait yeah i went to winter wonderland which i know isn't hide park that was also uh uh very fun it was greater than i imagined and the food marketplace is very exciting and festive even though i do think that winters and christmas is quite over rated sometimes it was nice to go there with my friends and then my family for new years another thing that i noted about the park and went to uh underland was that the rise were quite expensive which is very sad because i wanted to write all of them but they are way too expensive and out of budget for me as a student erm if you met someone new to it into the city what would you recommend they go see you do and i probably recommend them um
