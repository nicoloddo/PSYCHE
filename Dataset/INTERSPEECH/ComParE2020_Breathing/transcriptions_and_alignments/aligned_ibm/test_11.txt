okay uh well i would like to talk about as action my uh my recent christmas holiday because it's quite a interesting and and special in you and um different one um my partner i decided this year that we were just gonna take a few short days just exactly around the christmas dates to um to go to vienna uh we had been on occur on a christmas holiday last year uh in germany for uh some of those christmas markers and we really loved it and we had read that uh vienna supposed to have actually one of the best christmas markets uh in all of europe and he was kind of uh around the summer that i was just uh uh looking at um at christmas plans and uh and yeah vienna came up and actually there is a very interesting art exhibition that came up um there displaying uh albert jurors uh the hair which is a very famous water color painting that is normally not on public display uh they were displaying it for four months including over christmas so that kind of sealed the deal uh we just went ahead and booked the flights on the middle of the summer um quickly found a comedies we'd been to vienna once before and we knew where to stay um excellent hostile there uh and yeah we booked that uh that room and it was for the twenty third to the twenty six are uh literally right over christmas it turns out that uh uh vienna's fantastic city to visit over christmas um one of the reasons being that almost everything is actually open even on christmas day which i find is really quite unusual most in most cities even um the big ones like you really can't find much to do at all on christmas day but no the uh vianies like to keep things open um and so yeah we flew there on uh monday the twenty third uh immediately after checking and we went out to the christmas markets and honestly they were some of the most extraordinary um christmas markets i had uh ever seen uh especially the uh the big one which is right uh in the um the square where the town hall is uh it's it's pretty massive it's pretty colorful um it's pretty large they even have an ice rink that has apparently three kilometers worth of skating not that we did this uh gating but it uh was really quite interesting to see and yeah just some really great food like some uh some really great grill sausages we had and and some progress and it was really fan uh it was really quite a spectacular place to be um however the city actually has marcus throughout the city and we we covered a few of the other ones a few of the smaller ones um i think my favorite one was the one just uh outside of the big um cathedral there this is saint steve was done uh uh we got some really great actually that how that one had the best mald wine that of the whole city was uh one of the best mold wines i'd ever taste in my life um and we had regard we got some uh really nice kind of souvenirs and gifts um my partner bought a uh a nice water color painting of the the uh the town hall christmas market that we uh just been to um and yeah it was just a really nice feel in the city these markets were even open on christmas e christmas day boxing day uh likewise the um the exhibition that we were going to see that uh we went on christmas day the museum was open um we also had a really lovely um christmas dinner at uh at a uh kind of uh uh beer hall chain that you find throughout germany and and an austria august um
