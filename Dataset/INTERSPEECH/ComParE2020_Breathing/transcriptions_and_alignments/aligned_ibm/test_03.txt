so i'm in london because i live in london and i work in london and i live in north london uh open horns a uh kind of between term pick lane and possible uh help and i work at ucl which is in bloom spring the center of london i've lived here for about uh fifteen years um the things i really like about london i really like that london is huge um and i like that it's busy and i like this full of all the different types of people you ever might encounter and i like that within that uh it has really nice little times and and areas that have different character but also that they're constantly evolving and you always find something you and so i really feel like that that phrase is true about you know when you've grown tired of london you've gone tired of life um some of things i don't like about london uh i probably would notice that i don't like how much of a hurry everyone is in and maybe without a bit of cold if i was if i was spending more time in other places like uh jim i was recently in the united states and everyone was so overwhelmingly friendly and it really strikes you when you go back to london when everyone's just got the head done um but i respect that so uh that don't like definitely not like it i i don't like the fact that it's so expensive um it gives me everything looking um gives me everything but i i hate that it's really expensive to buy property and things like that and that's uh been a bit limiting to every favor restaurant cuisine um i'm gonna tell you but where i'm going tomorrow so tomorrow i'm going to polish restaurant which is near where i live and i'm going to have period which is uh dumplings um that you can get filled with me to filled with cheese and i'm uh going to taste from some volca that would uh uh have some lots of delicious little salty bits and pieces to eat um so i really like polish food i realize turkish food of which there's loads in the uh area where i live so already uh enjoy that have uh been to end of the parks in london i have been to loads of parks in london i do have parks that i really like one is closer park which is installed uh nintend i used to live near there i think it's just really nice size there's lots of stuff going on people really use the park and it's attractive to look up and i live right beside alexander park which is side alexander palace and i really enjoy that it's really good for going and looking for um people i walk in their dogs and looking at nice dogs so lots of people have different little yabby things and big blood honest and irish will funds and all sorts and uh i just find it really entertaining um if i met someone you will recommend the go and see or do i would recommend that people go to um um some good craft beer breeze and their lots around there are some around both them still which quite good is quite a bit of variety there and i think people should go and have turkish food on green lanes in north uh london and just stroll around and kind of soak it up i think you can't get better hospitality than in some of those restaurants um i have been to tourist attractions obviously because i've lived here for so long i don't do it that often i've been on the london i um which i really enjoyed um other things that i've done i've sometimes gone on the like the kind of commuter boat up and down the terms uh is quite a good thing to do with visitors um and in terms of museums i quite like the um dinosaur bit of the natural history museum i absolutely adore the ground museum which is part of you see uh has lots of um just lots of specimens of all sorts of different types of animal and it's kind of in this old victorian style uh lots of things in jars you can sponsor specimens there and have your name kind of on top of the jar for a year um which is quite cute um and other uh touristy things that i like to do i uh think walking on the south uh bank is really pleasant and fun and uh quite like the architecture there um but mostly i think what i like to do in london is to
