so uh i've come to london for uh multiple reasons firstly uh i got married in september and my now husband works at here in london say i moved here to join him here but also i got a job um here it ecl to work as a post stock um which was lucky given my husband was here say so that was that was kids um london's quite different i was in oxford before um which is a much smaller city and i find london um quite busy and quite overwhelming and but we live quite far out um so michael went to hell which i've heard described is um just really not uh very like london uh um given uh it is in london it's very quiet and fills quite suburban and we have a village green and it's quite nice say i actually uh uh like being able to escape the center and travel back out to the quiet suburbs but come in for work um and have the option to come in and um have all the attractions of london close by but um not too close um we did think about moving further in so that my commute would be better uh but we decided we just liked it um further out where it was a bit quieter and like uh me isn't too bad um it's thirty five minutes door to door which is pretty good for london so um i feel like we kind of have the best of both worlds in that way but there are there are lots of things i like about london to like there are a lot of concerts here which is nice like we didn't have so many back in oxford so it's cool to get to see bands i like much more easily and the food as well me and my husband quite like going to restaurant stickly he likes uh um uh uh um um um uh uh quite posh places so uh when his uh mum comes to visit we clarify and go somewhere uh uh nice in london she really likes her good food to um so yeah we've been to quite a range of different places um round where we are there's a lot of italian restaurants um not quite sure why i think there's called a uh big italian community uh um which it's probably my favorite term food so that's quite nice and so yeah we enjoy going out for for food uh quite a lot and the parks in london are called to um we have quite a few round where we are but i like the fact that even in the center uh you have these quite big um open spaces that you can go to i um really like hide park for example uh that's really nice but most of them are uh a pretty nice um so i definitely recommend those to people coming to london for the first uh time i think the parks are one of the best things about london um but there's this kind of there's all sorts uh something i would probably recommend if someone was new to the city um would be something called the wallest collection which is kind of like this old house where six centric old man used to live i think maybe he was an architectural something but he collected a lot of different things a lot of random bizarre things and they're all in this house and it's just a really interesting collection of objects and uh civil buildings kind of full thrown in together and that's quite cool and i'm not sure many people know about that so that's probably what i would recommend to someone it's a good uh if they when you say to london but i um uh haven't really been to many of the other sort of big tourist attractions like that london i um i do there i think they're just often so busy um and a full of people that i tend to stay clear probably um uh more i've been to tourist attractions in terms of shopping
