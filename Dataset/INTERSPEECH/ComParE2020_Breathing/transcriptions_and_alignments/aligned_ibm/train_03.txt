uh as i moved to london in two thousand and ten when i started at university at ucl so first uh uh i studied speech and language therapy and i did the undergraduate program air uh which was four years i have said before that i lived in working which wasn't isn't too far away from uh london anyway and but after that i moved away from london for uhm another two years and moved back home um to working and then moved back again in um well about three years ago uh um back to chisex now i live in uh london full time as there's some things i like about london i love that you can kind of do anything you want at uh any time you want and there's never a boring weekend there's always something more to go and see or to go and look at or that you haven't visited before even if you are revisiting things that you uh uh really like i also love that it's really easy and to get around town so there's loads of ways to travel i am on the overground uh and underground and on the buses so it's really easy turkey uh out and about a the other thing i love is that and they have lots of are vegan options in london so i um uh became vegan in january this year and uh found that there's so uh uh many options um available in and around london but these kind of reduce quite a lot when you go out uh of london so it's really great that to have the all these options available uh on your doorstep um some things i don't like about london um i hate my commute uh so i have to commute in from west london every day and it uh takes me about an hour each way and it's definitely the worst part uh of my day and i hate having to go home uh in the dark in the evening on the tube and then walk another ten minutes in the rain i'd love to live a bit closer and that i can't uh what else did i like about london um it's really busy all of the uh time and you can't stand still anywhere cause there's always someone i'm trying to get past you um but i also really like that uh uh aspect of london that it is busy and there's always a uh good atmosphere wherever you go erm i um uh don't really have a favorite restaurant in london um tend to eat in quite a few different places don't uh tend to go back to the same place um but like i said i vegan so always are uh uh looking for new places to try um but they uh typically tend to be in east london which is kind of annoying because i live in west london and so it's a little bit of a uh track there and to go and visit a few of those uh places uh if i met someone new in the city i'd probably recommend um that they go and visit all the uh different um kind of little suburbs in london so uh kind of north london is obviously uh really different from and south and east london and they've all got their own character and they're all own um vibe going on so it be kind of a uh uh miss if you didn't go and see all of those different areas to get a real fill for the city um and i say get out of uh central london um get out of all the tourist traps and just go and see where people live um and go and see some of the smaller areas and have a little wand around and you'll always find something interesting to do i haven't actually been to that many of the terrorist attractions i think i've been on the land and i about ten years ago and went to the london dungeons otherwise tend to try and avoid them cause they're always very busy and very expensive um london i was good maybe a little overrated maybe a little uh overpriced but it is an icon and so i can see why people would want to cover and have a go on it okay um what i shall i talk about um have i been to any of the parks in london and um yeah i used to live um on garage uh street so uh my local part used to be reading
