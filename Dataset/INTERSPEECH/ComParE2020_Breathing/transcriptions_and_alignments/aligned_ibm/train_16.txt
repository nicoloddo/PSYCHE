um so i'm gonna talk about my favorite subject which is london um i was born in london in london bridge um so i'm one of the few er real londoness um and your note assist at christmas when a london's empty because everybody goes back uh to the sorry or whether they're from and uh they leave london to the uh real london and so it's the uh best time to go out drink here or go to a restaurant and stuff with his is now in around erm over uh christmas we normally go to a pub in charing cross road um and it's wondered only ones at home uh open between christmas and new year and it's they have a uh great dreg show there and so we normally go there and then we go to the waffle shop after in a near old content uh street and out of waffles and stuff but um i've lived in london my whole life and it's my favorite place in the world er even though i'm a bit biased um one of the things that love about it is even during this time of er its populism and right when we still kind of liberal and we celebrate difference and we celebrate different cultures and foods and music and people and places and stuff at that and that's one of the reasons why i'm so proud of uh being from london erm my firmly have lived in the same area for about three hundred years we can trace back erm and unfortunately i'm the last person of my family to uh live in the year or so unless i have children that would uh uh be our family named stead erm in that error she is quite sad and but uh still live i live in the burmans ear of london which was when i was a kid it was still quite a uh post industrial there was empty factories and it was kind of run down there wasn't uh much development um and it was kind of dark and run down but in some ways are still i missed that and it's quite interesting that we're nostalgic about the things that we that were quite bad for us um it's changed quite a lot in the recent times there's no uh uh buildings and coffee shops and new people that is hard to not fill it as uh lost it so in uh er some way and i think is the double edge sort out i like uh that there's no uh development but i just wish that they would leave some of the stuff for the people that live ran as the lawn drets and the pubs and stuff like that the kind of were the social places of the area that kind of er a disappearing now erm i've lived in lots of places all over the world but have always kept uh my flat in london so that i can come home whenever i want um lived in new york for a bit which was kind of like london on the steroids but super neurotic city people shown each other uh lived in sydney for a bit melbourne south africa south america have lived in africa for little bits of time erm but there's no place like london um so i'd like to stay you so if i can when i'll finish my phd because a i don't really want to move away and seems to be a common um problem in academia is that there's fearing a few of jobs as uh the academics work into uh whirling to their eighties and stuff then for the young people coming up there's less than this jobs in research and especially um jobs in london and academics are forced to move all over the world to get work so er not really short uh a solution is when i'm trauma best to stay in london for that er the icing that he's uh uh got lots of interest in people and do an interest in project's mind um project his erm about what uh happens to uh your sleep structure when you lose your vision erm so there's different i diseases affect different parts of the iresome uh um diseases affect the image forming layers of the eye other uh other diseases affect the the retinal gangling there uh which which um is the rest in place for these certain class of cells which tell the brain when it's daytimer when it's night time um and in certain blind pages
