so my instrument uh and i've lived in london my whole life my favorite thing about london are the museums and of the um community centers uh and yet to ease that you can do uh around now the pubs and the clubs i guess uh my favorite area would be south kensington um around there at night's bridge to have loss of um nice european food mast um they have a talk about the things that you already get in other places in london i guess compared to where i live um is nice apart as well that i have um you have the bikes in london which did there isn't much in the uh rural areas as well but there are uh starts time to be bill out and i guess my favorite restaurant um used to be nandles but it's now more um i do like a buffer uh that there is a quite near my neighborhood so they serve lots of different types of food so they serve pizza and that my favorite food would be um indian food to be honest late curry so it would be the curry and the uh chicken lamb and the different types of rises this displaces that they have which i do not some of the names and so they have the tales and stuff and stuff that was the uh pompo themselves uh which is something nice nothing nice which because of the indian my favorite fruit and uh yeah but uh i guess in london there isn't really too many indian places that i um would go to uh to eight and so um my favorite places would be close to my home in that regards and um i guess i went to university in london and so while i was there that in uh impairer and south kansas and so that's another uh reason why uh sockets and is a favorite area of wine and then we have the um other doing um medicine so up when i was studying medicine i um only done the best new the first year and so now i decided to work is still in london but um you know also is interested in didn't research what was on the uh was interested in research that become an a fair prison psychiatrist by guess i was always uh thinking not you know i wasn't really into that the surgical aspects of medicine uh so we uh will see how to do every everything uh lenin calls but was really into kind of bodies and doing some of us are software up and find a different part and i i have referred uh um it it'd be easy for me to start working out maybe go back to university letter on um and so i'm i might go to imperial uh see little uh uh also from um different courses that they offer similar things i guess i would still want to stay in london if i go to universe uh uh um i guess got the idea of going to a place outside of london to local more rural area wouldn't be to um entice it for me because i guess i have um most of my school and earlier on done in a more rural saying than um the london way and was there uh like the fact that it's near loss of uh um different places uh different types of restaurants and stuff like that and um i guess in london the best the best things usually are kind of just like in the senate so uh where you know where they have all the different uh museums like in lessons and square um i'd recommend um people to go to maybe the science museums and like the art museums
