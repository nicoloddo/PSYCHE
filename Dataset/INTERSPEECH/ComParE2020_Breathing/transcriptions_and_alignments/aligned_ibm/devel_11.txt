uh so i came to london because i decide to study abroad in my junior spring semester uh i chose london out of all the cities in the uh world because i've actually never been to europe or the uh uk um so i was really intrigued and interested in like life in london the culture in london just i thought that those lot of things to like look look out and also explore about in london so i chose london as my final destination um you see all was it uh was one of my top choices for uh school so study up because uh i like that a lot of schools around the area as well but my school back home is in the suburban role area and i also uh kind of grown up in like a suburban neighborhood and i really wanted experience what it was like living in a city and i thought that setting abroad during this time would be really great and i also enjoyed that uh you see all although it was in the center of london had its own campus which is something that i look very strongly in for schools um which also decided my school back home as well um i've only been in london for about two weeks but i really like how accessible everything in london is unlike things are like a few minutes walk here or a few minutes walk there and it's really great because it gets me to exercise as well which i would have never done back home at my school or anywhere in general to be honest um i also really like how there is a variety of cuscines out london and i can really find like um restaurants from all over the place like here which are like close and proximity or just like right next door to each other which i think is a great way to really try foods from other countries and also just kind of explore the culture of london uh uk itself um another thing i like about london is how all the museums are free most museums are free um i haven't gone to all of them yet but i've gone to some and i think it's a really great way to learn about history and a really exciting way as well um some things i do not like about london i think uh this is not like specific to london but i don't like how early the sun sats it's kind of sad when i look out the costroom at like four thirty pm and it's super dark outside and sometimes i have events that have been at like six pm and walking in the window rain but it's definitely better than walking in the window um rain at rochester so i guess it's like i saw that i don't like it it's just not something i look forward to um i think another thing that i don't like about uh it might be just because i'm not like used to it but the crossing at london some people just go streets so i feel like i'm like too scared sometimes i like i'll put uh a foot down and then check uh i see that there's no cars and i'll try to go but then i get scared and i like go back to side off uh in their way into super long until the light changes sometimes i feel god because that uh everyone else has gone and i'm just there so that's just something i have to get used to um do i have a favorite restaurant or cuisine uh yes i do it actually recently opened up the russia opened up near me at my home town it's called hide the law it's a chinese hot pot place and it actually is available in london in picadelli circus and i thought the other day when i went with friends just walk uh around so i'm very excited but uh there's something i'm familiar with and i can go back and try because it's a really really good hot hot place i really recommend it um how i've been to any of the parks in london i actually haven't gone to any parks in london yet or any of the big parks i mean i've walked around some parks but i never went in i think that's definitely something i have to do because where i come from parks really honor thing we have like one state part near my house rochester because uh quite a bit of parks as well i just haven't gone which is probably something i should do there as well um if i met someone new so i
