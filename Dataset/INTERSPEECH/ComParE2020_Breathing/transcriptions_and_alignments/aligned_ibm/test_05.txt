i first came to london to start my uh mse and then to do my phd because i really wanted to work with someone here at ucl um so i moved to london but it's not actually somewhere i ever wanted uh uh uh to move umm at first i found it really big um because i grew up in quite small cities um and things take a really long time to get to places but actually as i've lived here um i've enjoyed it a lot more um yeah i've found public transport here is is really good generally um but once i started cycling in london that was really great uh because it's a lot faster to get to different places and there are uh some really good cycle routes to and from work for me um i find it a bit more scary to cycle on routes that i don't know because there's a lot of traffic um but it's generally really good um and good to get some exercise uh i also quite like traveling on the bus rather than on the tube uh because it's much nicer to be above ground than underground and it's also really noisy on the tube i i don't really have a favorite restaurant in london um but i there are some really nice ones um particularly ethiopian um food which i'm going to tonight i'm uh looking forward to um yeah there are uh there are lots of different styles of food um we also like to uh go to efficient uh place quite near us that has really good quality fish and also great hello me um which is really good um yeah yeah i really like the area of london that i'm in i think my my uh favourite bit is uh hamstered heath and um going to places like kenward house because you can sort of escape london a little bit and get to somewhere a bit quieter and there are really great views of london from there that um if you climb up the hill um especially in the evening it's really nice to climb up the hill and just look over the city when the lights go on um yeah um really good views and actually from the top of hampshire heath as well there's uh great um uh um panorama's of of all of the city but you feel nicely removed from the city uh which is really good and also at uh kenwit house they have really good tea and scones um and yeah it's just a really nice place to walk and see lots of people with their dogs um and they have good lakes there as well and places that you can swim in well some people swim their uh all the around uh which seems a bit mad and freezing cold i've swung there uh once in the summer on a boiling hot day in the middle of a very hot summer and it was so cold my hands sort of um cramped up um so i don't know quite how they manage it in the middle of winter uh but there are people who swim in um sort of um uh all year uh um but it does get really busy in the summer particularly when it's hot and that's a really fun thing to do in london so that's definitely the place i take visitors when they come and see me in london is actually not to the sort of classic sites like the london i or uh um anything really in the centre uh maybe because lots of my friends aren't massively keen on big cities or loads of uh people um so we tend to go walking instead uh in places that are a little bit quieter
