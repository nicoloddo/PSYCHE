yeah so i've been in london for the past uh two years nobody i was in cambridge before that for year um my wife's doing her phd at uh ucl in near signs she's at um the s e n at queens square when we first moved here we moved to um camped in town uh that was like a student housing it was okay it was cheap and big was really big for london in central um kind of grimy that had an awful blue carpet but it wasn't a huge deal and we uh had no control over the heat so was freezing cold in the winter time uh and they were undergrads above us and around uh us it wasn't a huge deal but um it was weird we could hear in the bathroom the undergrads uh uh partying in the kitchen above us but it was strange because you could only really hear it in the bathroom so we'd be sleeping in a bedroom in silence we'd go to the bathroom and it would be like this party club just funny anyway the kick us out of there we moved to a couple of other places since then um we were in kentuchtown uh which was cool um well it was okay we paid thirteen hundred pounds a month it was way too much and it's like a tiny place there are these awful people above us that were really obnoxious and loud uhm but yeah and that in the house it was really small the bathroom was tiny in the toilet was disgusting we had a one year uh lease but we broke it uh basically to say the upstream uh people are intolerable and then we move to high gate to which where we are now and it's equally small but it's way cheaper saving like three hundred fifty pounds a month which is amazing um and it's a quieter area it's nice um i read my bike to work so it's not a huge deal i uh guess in terms of the community um i like london there's a something uh uh to do in london and you can just for like walk in random directions there's less you can enjoy i mean like on a day off not have to think like what should i do today in my small town um you don't have to spend a lot of money in london to have a nice time you can walk round and see a lot of amazing things even though obviously can spend a lot of uh money in london um i like the history of it i like the people like the diversity people are really kind um yeah it's sort of like dead down to earth i find except for the parts that are completely not down to earth i guess there's just a lot of extremity in london and i like all the burrows i like all the like um diversity not uh noticing the people but in the feelings of the different burrows where you kind of feel it london feels like a lot of small towns kind of squish together um which i find really cool because you can get lots of different vibes trending if you're wanting something more kind of quaint and cozy or something more you know business corporate or something more um exciting night club greedy whatever you want that's there um that what i don't like about london i mean everyone talk about the pollution thank uh god for city con in the mayor and the his uh merrill staff who are trying to do something about it i actually read to day i think that lends actually having its first zero emissions street which means that it's it's not pedestrianized which is what immediately uh thought it's um it's a street for cars but they have to be electric vehicles or vehicles that don't have any emissions so basically as you're driving up to the street there's all these signs being like don't come down here if you're a polluter i'm uh not really sure what happens if you drive down it and you don't have an electric vehicle whether they're all like puppy finds or why but anyway i think that's cool but yet the pollution's gross um i don't i like about london commuting the tube speaking of pollution what's going on with the tube i mean we live it's like the twenty first century and like the most polluted thing ever i mean for first world i guess i guess it's a privilege thing to say
