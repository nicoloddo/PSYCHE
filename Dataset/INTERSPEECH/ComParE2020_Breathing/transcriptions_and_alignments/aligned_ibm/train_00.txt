yeah so i'm in london right now because i am doing a phd and cognitive nearest science um i was living in cambridge when i was doing my master's degree and i was really interested in studying here in uh london because you see uh uh is a really great school for neuroscience um it's highly productive there's lots of really interesting stuff going on lots of talks uh and it just seem like a good place to apply and my supervisor at cambridge uh strongly recommended that i got in touch with my current supervisor um here you see and one thing led to another and um now i'm here and i've been here for three years now so one of the uh some of the things i like about london um i think it has really really great community um i know it's cliche to say that london's vibrant but it it really is um it's so multi cultural multi lingual um people look after each other i've been on the tube uh by the bus so many times where someone's needed help and people russian um yes so i just i really appreciate how people look after each other and the sense of community and solidarity um it's kind of almost feels like the utopian dream sometimes the way that we can all work together in this big city so some of the things they don't like about london are um there is it pretty extreme in a quality here so you see really really poor people lots of rough sleepers and then you also see people who are like oil tycoons and finance people and it's uh kind of it's sad that um there's so much inequality in the society here um and i'm also not a big fan of the pollution uh it's it's definitely it takes its tool on your quality of life um in terms of favorite food or cuisine in london i am a big fan of indian and bingo deshi food um there's lots of great stuff here in london although i've been told birmingham is the place to go for really good indian um i also have a few favorite chinese restaurants and um and yeah basically you can get any cuisine you want in london have i been to any of the parks in london uh yes so i go to parks all the time i like to run and i uh tend to run in places like hamster heath the most because it's a big park lots of nature especially given the pollution in london it's a really nice place to uh sort of reconnect with like trees and greenery if i met someone new to the city i would definitely recommend they check out the parks um or just walk around the neighbourhoods like leave the center of the city because the tourist stuff is really impressive um it's definitely worth walking along south bank for example but i think where london really shines is the small neighborhoods places i didn't discover until i moved here uh in terms of tourist attractions i did go because someone took me as a guest to the dungeons um i was act so i went in with like pretty low expectations um but i actually ended up having a pretty good time it was spooky sure um but mostly it was actually pretty entertaining especially given like um the actors who kind of like jump out at you um i would say they try and kind of make it like educate meant and you learn about london's history i don't know how successfully but i feel like if you're with someone who really wants to go share take the
