i came to london to um study at uh uh ucl i came to london from new york i came to london to study philosophy in particular i'm studying for my m fill a ucl uh uh um i part of why i came to london also is the city itself um it's a very interesting big city and coming from new york i wanted to live in another city that was interesting to me and had a lot of culture a lot of museums a lot of music going on um art scenes so i came for school first but beyond that the ability to live a life that i found interesting um i like about london um the fact that there is a lot going on i like the amount of parks there are actually is one of my favorite things um living in new york there is really only two big parks well there are a few big parks but the two biggest parks i would frequent where central park and prospect park outside of that you just have very tiny park some the size of a parking lot so what i like about one is i live close to hampson heath of close to regions park as well and i can frequent those massive parks very easily beyond that there's a lot of other parks to though even just in the north we have victoria park we have others as well um so i like being outside in london i like um exploring i like taking pictures in the parks taking going to concerts going to shows going to museums um what do i dislike about london i just like the weather sometimes um i'm i rains a lot in london as you might now so i just like uh the the idea that it's all like i wake up and it's raining and i go to bed it's raining and sometimes it's very gloomy and that can be a little bit depressing to not see the sun very often which an issue the issue of nothing the sun very often is exacerbated by there being um very short days during the winter once it turns into daylight savings time um it's dark by um four pm completely pitch back by five pm at the latest i'd say four thirty pm um and when it's reading uh outside all day and i don't wake up often i don't wake up to about eleven o'clock on the side of school and really my closest my earliest uh day is eleven pm so i'm on our house by ten so there you know um it's only five hours and then when you have class you have work the days go by very quickly and you don't see a lot of the son and i do miss that so that's one thing i dislike about london to a favor um my favorite restaurant is not available in london um my favorite restaurant is actually my dad's restaurant he owns uh italian restaurant in north carolina in the united states um and it's not available on london obviously but my favorite type of cuisine is certainly available in london have a few different i once have one particular type of cuisine that's my favorite i like um well i cook a lot actually so that's all available one and i could uh call out with tofu echo called vegetables uh cook meat very much so yeah that's that's all that is available and i just don't utilize it but i do like to go to restaurants i don't have a particularly favorite though um i would say that there's anyone that's my favorite i've been to any parts of uh yes i've been to a lot of parcel in my favorite park is here two parks or regions and hampson heath um i'd say that my favorite between those two is hampson he uh has a little bit more of a queen as to it um regents feels like it's too organized for me um regions park it's very nice
