what brings you to london um i moved here to start in m press um program at uh uh ucl previously in new york so that was a kind of a tough decision to leave the united states but i did want to get out of the net united states for sure but i i i uh mean i could have stayed i guess in new york and my job for one more year maybe see where that lead but that's what brings me here so i guess exploration but also mainly school um what are some things i like about london i uh like like the program i like the relatively calmer pace of life compared to my situation in new york for sure i like that i'm not commuting two hours a day on the train um i like yeah i like i like the apartment better uh sure um yeah or some things you do not like public don't like that it rains every day a uh uh lot of days also don't like currently like the winter because it's dark out a lot which there is more son more more um uh hours in the day light um yeah yeah uh do you have a favorite restaurant christian so i love mexican food also love uh vietnamese food but so they have tripola here that's like my favorite restaurant in the states but it's a little different i'm not it's not worse or better but um it's different um got it a few times but i've been trying to eat more well i need to save money because i don't have as much sudden eating more home cooking meals i do feel like some of the food here is uh better quality um though um compared to like maybe the preservatives they put a lot of food in the states i don't know maybe that's a thing here i just notice that but interestingly i haven't really only had vietnamese food the far one time since i've moved here and i would get it like multiple times a week new york there's uh well i think it's interesting because there's uh a vietnamese place right across the street for me i still have not been there uh okay next question have you been to any of the parks uh uh yeah i've i just went to high park this past weekend which was very very nice um i really like me my fiancee one and she loves nature and the animals um is very nice seeing like go by the pond i really like that part and sing all like the geese they swans the huge swan and how they're just not really afraid of humans here it's nice uh uh symbiatic relationship they have where they get fat they can approach humans and take pictures and uh get fed um really cool uh but as far as the part i so i've been to that park i've been doing one other part i can't remember the name i need to do more this is just generally i need to do more exploring of the city though i feel like during the semester i focus a lot on work and i've been off and i've had somewhat of a break and haven't really done exploring i don't know when i will um i should be taking more advantage of that um if you met someone new to the city what would you recommend they go to c or do i probably wouldn't be the best to our guide at this point um i would just say like i i really like the area around picadilly circus i mean that it's probably pretty touristy but you could even just walk around there for a few hours and there's a uh lot to see i have to do um depending whatever food you like um can definitely find it in that area oh okay i know i i got a killed time but i want to go back up to what i don't
