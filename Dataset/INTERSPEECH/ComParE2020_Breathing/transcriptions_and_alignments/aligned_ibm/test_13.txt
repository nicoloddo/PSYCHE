okay uh i i've always quite slagged london um most of my families here so i guess i would say perhaps family is the uh main reason but i also um i like the fact that it's so green and it's quite multicultural and there's just so much things to do um so any places to go so yeah i would say that's what brings me him um in terms of things i like about london i would say i like the green spaces and i also like the father there so many restaurants and uh uh there's always something to do like it never really sleeps there's always something to do so i you can never really get bored i think um there's so many like free museums and the galleries and all of that so yeah uh um uh in terms of what i don't like what i said don't like about london it's a bit too busy uh sometimes it can be a bit too fast based i think so uh uh um i think it needs to slow down sometimes this would be too fast and also i think people don't look out for each other as much as they should people can be unkind um but i guess it's a cultural thing i perhaps do it sometimes as well so um yeah i would perhaps say that's i do i have a favorite restaurant and uh um not necessarily actually i wouldn't say i have a favorite restaurant in london uh um yeah i wouldn't say perhaps i need to guess i would see more restaurants to uh be able to make um uh judgments on that but i wouldn't necessarily say i do um in terms of the parts i do as i said like that's one of the favorite my favorite things about london i quite like the green spaces and um i would say my favorite i haven't been to all the pogs but um if i were to ultimately choose a favorite one it would perhaps be ham said heath um although richmond park is a close second but i i really really like hamster heap i would say try all the museums in the galleries uh i think there's just so much to learn they're so fascinating and they're also free which is not very common in other countries so i would say definitely for starters try all the museum and museums and gather is and um yeah that would be my recommendation i have been to i haven't actually been to the london i as yet but i haven't uh been um on the river things though the the boat ride and you basically get a very nice view of all the the money men send basically all the attractions in london and it uh uh was nice i wouldn't say it was overrated necessarily but um i think it was just okay um it was uh it was a nice activity to do um but i would definitely like to try the london i at some point um and perhaps madam to solids i've actually never been there as well um but i think that would perhaps be overrated because um i guess from my understanding is just basically walks school
