So I'm a very big fan of restaurants especially in London I think one of my favorite things is going to new restaurants and I read a lot of restaurant reviews to find out restaurants to go to I'm quite proud of the fact that I often tend to be the person to pick restaurants I go to friends I uh think I have quite good taste in restaurants So in terms of a favorite restaurant um I would say that I would prefer going to a new restaurant restaurant to one that I've already been to but some very old reliable ones I quite like caravan which is a very nice chain of restaurants around London There's one in bankside there's one in King's Cross and uh they do really good sharing plate type food of restaurants I haven't been to yet that I really like to go to ah Black axe mangle is a very exciting looking Turkish kabab restaurant but done by a proper chef who used to be at noma uh it's quite odd that it's quite uh posh food but then it's done in a restaurant that constantly plates heavy metal um so I'd quite like to go there but they only have tables for about 20 people um so that's my list of places I would like to go to in terms of my favorite cuisine uh again I'm not quite sure I just quite like things that are new I spend a lot of time on Instagram scrolling through looking at food finding new food to eat I saw a recipe recently uh in the Guardian uh from Osalangi for a choco flan where you put in the cake mixture first and then the custard for the flan And then in the oven they swap places So you end up with the flan on the top and the cake on the bottom which I think is really interesting And I just kind of want to make it just want to see that um so yeah what brings me to London Well I grew up here I grew up in North London and muzzler Hill and I went to school there I then left for a couple of years to go to uni and then very quickly decided that I probably wanted to do the rest of my studies and working in London So now I'm doing my PhD at ucl in neuroscience uh and I've stayed in London ever since But at the start of next year in 2020 I'm uh going to be moving to Edinburgh for a couple of months to work with my industry partner for my PhD where uh we will be developing the app for my project So um that'll be really exciting And I think Edinburgh looks like a really amazing city I tend to prefer to live in cities rather than smaller places I think just having grown up with having everything within arm's length and always open I think it'd be quite odd going somewhere where you kind of have to do everything between nine and five um I think be a bit depressing Also I don't drive which is definitely a very North London thing So I would find it quite hard to leave a city But I'm very excited about moving to Edinburgh for a short period of time What are some of the things I like about London Well I've already listed a few I uh think there's just so much to do in London and it's just so cultural and there's great food as I have mentioned at some length um so yes I definitely find it hard to leave London What do I not like about London I uh think some of the things that other people don't like about London in saying that London are quite cold they can be quite harsh and unfriendly place I quite like that I quite like the anonymity that you have living in a big city um I'm not sure what I don't like about London Maybe I'll find out after I moved to Edinburgh and realize that it's a lot better Have uh I been to any of the parks in London I have been to some of the parks in London I uh quite like St james's park I think it's quite nice um I like the terrapins and the pelicans that they have there which I think is quite fun I grew up next to alexandra Park
