Um I was born in London I've been in West London for all of my life I'm 27 now I was born in hillingdon Hospital in hounslow which is in West London And it is on one end of the piccadilly Line near to heathrow Airport Some of the things I like about London are ah that it's very easy to get around You um can meet lots of different people people from all around the world and try a lot of different things um particularly food music um traveling is very easy from here um what are some of the things I don't like about London It's very crowded I don't do well in crowds It can be really gloomy especially in the winter which seems to last for about nine months of the year It rains a lot um also I don't like that it's quite gray in terms of even the buildings and the pavements and everything is gray except in the summer it's fine um the one thing that is good though is that you can easily get to green spaces Apparently there are so many trees in London that it would actually officially be counted as a forest But obviously they're not all in the same place so it doesn't always feel like that Do I have a favorite restaurant M I'm not sure actually Have I been to any of the parks in London And do I have a favorite park Yes I do It's actually not one of the big ones My favorite park is Austerly Park which again is in West London where I live um you can get to that on the piccadilly Line as well if you stop at Austerally Station But it's one of their National Trust properties and it's a bit out of the way so it doesn't get a lot of people going there But it's got a big house um really big grounds It used to belong to a family who I think owned most of that area But they've um just turned the park bit of it into National Trust property It's got a lake um and a river And you can go canoeing on the river And they have like swans and ducks They also have rabbits And if you go during about the end of March beginning of April you can usually see baby ducks and baby rabbits um so it's really nice They also have cows horses chickens because they have a small working farm on the park So it's quite fun If someone was new to the city I would say probably go and see the parks because they're a good escape from the general hustle and bustle And um sometimes you need a break from that I'd say do all the touristy things because some of them are quite fun And I think especially if you live here and you've been here a long time you do miss out on doing those We also have lots of nice museums um and you can usually spend an entire day walking around one museum One particular thing that I like doing is every year they have the National Photographer the Nature Photographer of the Year and they present all the pictures in the Natural History Museum And that's always good to go and see I haven't really been to any of the tourist attractions like the London Eye We went on school trips so I've been to like madame to swords and the London dungeons and stuff like that um generally I'd say they are probably overrated I like more than nature stuff and parks and things like that and also going around museums at my own pace um other things to do in London would include I think one thing that I'm interested in doing is just going to random stations because sometimes when you're on a line so for example I take the big daily line every single day to work But I only go up to a certain point
