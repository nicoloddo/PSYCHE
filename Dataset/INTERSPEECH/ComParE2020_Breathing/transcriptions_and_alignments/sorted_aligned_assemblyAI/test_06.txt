I took a walk in St james's park I think that's a poem somehow which is rather rude which I'm not going to recite here but it's a ah restoration poem by the rochford I think And he went something in St james's park That's the first thing Jim St james's park is a very nice park I quite like going for a walk there It's got all the sights of London that you might want to see The buckingham Palace and the back of Downing Street and Horse Guards parade But if you walk off St james's park and you get to Green Park it's uh equally very nice It might seem rather boring because there's no flowers there It's all green hence its name And apparently the story goes that the mistress of some king or other and I'm going to say George the Fourth but I could be wrong lived across the park from St Jake Friday uh from Green Park Think she lived somewhere near the mall Not the mall what's that street called There's a street piccadilly street piccadilly something Anyway Near Green Park The station She lived there before the station was built And the old king used to cross over the park on his way to go and have his merry way with his mistress So the queen who was quite jealous of this she insisted that the park he walks through must not contain any blooms or flowers So she set a decree to make sure that he would always be remembered that the park he walks through on his way to his mistress would be devoid of color However I think it's quite a nice park So there we go Now walking further along I think you get to hyde Park which is ginormous even though ginormous is not an appropriate word I think But hyde Park is interesting If you want to go for a long walk or a cycle I'm not a big fan of it It's very often the park where people go to see things at speaker's Corner which used to be rather interesting back in the day when it was sort of very innocent and just some weird preacher But now people walk by thinking I wonder if this is going to be the next major terrorist Just two minutes five minutes Oh goodness gracious if I messed it up by stopping So if I continue along the park into hyde Park and I walk past there would be terrorists or crack or weird old people In fact you don't see them these days not as much as once upon a time you might have done And when you do there's often a big police pleasant presence So it's not a very pleasant place to spend a lot of time However if you're on roller blades it's grand to go scooting around the park that way Now I would say if my favorite park was in London it would probably be um the park next to my house It's not really a park it's more of a little graveyard um which might seem a bit more bid but it's very pretty and it has nice flowers in it and people often walk their dogs And I quite like a park with a lot of dogs I like dogs In fact I'm quite dog broodie I would have a dog myself if I could keep one in the flat If I walk further on to the next park nearby it's a bit crap so I don't go there very often Victoria park which I used to think was the biggest but isn't is another fine park It's one along the canal side So if you want to go a cycle and go along the Grand Union Canal and to Victoria Park and have an ice cream It's a grand day out in there I believe there's a little oriental garden in the middle of the pond which again is a nice little visit Going south of the river we could get to um Crystal Palace area And the Crystal Palace Park is pretty grand That's quite impressive Where it used to have um the old Crystal Palace where it gets its name which was the former site of the Grand Exhibition or where the Grand
