So the Great pyramid of geez a bit made me think about churches and how much I hate going in them <breath> And when I read here that people might have been even paid for building the <breath> pyramid <breath> I thought fuck that <breath> When you go in churches all you know is that people were forced to build them <breath> and that we're supposed to like them and that they're <breath> emblems of the most corrupt organization in the world <breath> ever And I even hate the smell of them <breath> because when I was young I was taught by nuns <breath> and forced to go to church every Sunday and even serve on the altar at 07 00 in the morning <breath> one week a month <breath> um I've never quite forgiven churches and I even hate the smell of them <breath> When I <breath> read about William herschel I thought we always <breath> um concentrate on what people did that worked <breath> um <breath> uh similarly with Newton we concentrate on what he got right but he was also a nutcase and <breath> um he worked on alchemy and tried to turn lead into gold <breath> But herschel's bit nuttery of <breath> was that he actually believed that there were people who were living on the moon <breath> And he held quite strongly for a long period of his life <breath> um to the belief that he had seen evidence <breath> of <breath> structures like trees and I can't remember if there were buildings but <breath> other things <breath> uh on the moon that proved that there were <breath> uh people <breath> people who lived there <breath> <breath> Same is true for linus pauling who won I think he won two Nobel prizes one for chemistry and one for <breath> one for biology He was in a race with Watson and crick for DNA <breath> But he in later life had this mad notion <breath> that if you took lords and lords and lords of vitamin C <breath> um it would obey cancer <breath> And <breath> because I <breath> like to try things out I did that at one time And all it does is make you go to the bathroom an awful lot <breath> um <breath> The North Wind and the sun uh made me think of something that I've <breath> piece uh of music that I've been <breath> writing which is actually called The North Wind And I wrote it for <breath> um the impending death of one of my friend's grandmothers <breath> um that's what that made me uh think of And <breath> the poetry made me think of <breath> neuroscience um <breath> um and a project I want to get one of my undergraduates to do which is I can't remember the lab it came from <breath> but there's a great <breath> paper showing how language or different words are mapped in <breath> different uh in um semantic structures in the brain And <breath> I have a hypothesis that if you take <breath> a top 100 of shakespeare's metaphors <breath> and <breath> almost anybody else's because he's ruined it for everybody else <breath> um that the distance in these maps between <breath> shakespeare's <breath> metaphorical images the things that he uses <breath> and other peoples <breath> will be greater And that one of the things that makes him so great <breath> Is that he does actually <breath> stretch things across the he makes us travel greater distances <breath> um uh in our brain <breath> The Other thing that M the porn Made Me Think of is about Going To bed by day because I'm <breath> an habitual napper <breath> um this morning I had to meet a friend for breakfast at 10 00 <breath> She lives an hour away I live ten minutes away and I was 15 minutes late for A 10 00 breakfast <breath> because I really can't do mornings <breath> And uh I do go to bed Every day <breath> even if I come into the icm I'll go home for A nap in the afternoon <breath> And in my office I used to have a bed and <breath> I removed it because too many people in the icm were taking naps in my office <breath> And it began to smell <breath> um <breath> and <breath> um the second poem <breath> uh <breath> didn't um make me think of anything at all Actually So um I <breath> have nothing to say about that one <breath> Counting from one to 40 strangely made me think about Brian butterworth because <breath> um he Works on numerical cognition And <breath> <breath> uh he was one of the people who got me to <breath> uh be interested in how the brain processes uh numbers <breath> So that was what one to 40 made Me think of <breath> And then I Started To Get nervous because I thought oh gosh <breath> um what if the next test is Kind Of harder and I have to count backwards in sevens and
