So UM my name is jamel and I've lived in London my whole life <breath> My favorite thing about London <breath> are the museums and all of the <breath> UM community centers and all the activities that you can do around there all the pubs and the clubs I guess uh my favorite area would be <breath> South kensington <breath> UM around there at Night's Bridge they have lots of <breath> of <breath> nice UM European food <breath> UM <breath> they have a taco Bell There are things that you don't really get in other places in London <breath> I guess compared to where I live <breath> UM there's nicer parks as well <breath> UM you have the bikes in London Which there isn't <breath> much in those rural Areas as well but there are starting to <breath> be <breath> built out And I guess my favorite <breath> restaurant used <breath> UM nando's to be but it's now more UM <breath> I do like a buffet that there is quite near my neighborhood So they serve lots of different types of food so they serve pizza <breath> And <breath> my favorite food would be <breath> UM Indian food to be honest Like curry So it would be the curry and The chicken lamb <breath> and the different types of rice and <breath> spices that they have Which <breath> I do know some of the names And so they have potatoes and stuff and stuff like that as well So they have pompedoms <breath> which is something Nice nothing nice which gods of <breath> the Indian being my favorite food <breath> and yeah but I guess in London there isn't really too many Indian places that <breath> I UM would go to <breath> to eat <breath> And so UM my favorite places would Be close to my home <breath> in that regard And UM I guess I went to university <breath> in London And so <breath> while I was there I was <breath> imperial in South kensington So <breath> that's another reason why south is A <breath> favorite area <breath> of mine And then we have the UM <breath> I was doing UM <breath> medicine So when I was studying medicine <breath> i UM only done basically the first year <breath> And so now I decided to work still in London <breath> But UM I was always interested in doing research <breath> I was interested in research like becoming a <breath> therapist a psychiatrist <breath> But I guess I was always thinking That <breath> uh I wasn't really into the surgical aspects of medicine And so we obviously had to do <breath> every everything we were learning the course but I wasn't really into cutting the bodies and doing <breath> some of that stuff So I thought I can find a different path <breath> And I <breath> have felt like UM <breath> it'd be easy for me to start working now and maybe go back to university <breath> later on <breath> And so <breath> I might go to improve There's lots of UM different courses <breath> that do offer similar things I guess I would <breath> still want to stay in London if I go to university UM <breath> UM I guess <breath> <breath> <breath> the idea of going to a place outside of London to like a more rural area <breath> wouldn't be too <breath> enticing for me because I guess I had most UM <breath> of my school and earlier on <breath> <breath> done in a more rural setting <breath> than UM London would be And obviously I like the fact that it's near <breath> lots of UM different places <breath> uh different types of restaurants and stuff like that And I UM <breath> guess <breath> in London the best <breath> things <breath> usually are kind of just like in the center <breath> to where <breath> they have all the different museums like in lechester Square <breath> I'd recommend UM people to go to <breath> maybe the science museums and like the art museums
