So I'm a very big fan of restaurants especially in London I think one of my favorite things is going to new restaurants and I read a lot of restaurant reviews to find out restaurants to go to <breath> I'm quite proud of the fact that I often tend to be the person to pick restaurants I go to friends <breath> I uh think I have quite good taste in restaurants <breath> So in terms of a favorite restaurant <breath> um <breath> I would say that <breath> I would prefer going to a new restaurant to restaurant one that I've already been to but some very old reliable ones <breath> I quite like caravan which is a very nice chain of restaurants around London There's one in bankside there's one in King's Cross <breath> and uh they do really good sharing plate type food <breath> of restaurants I haven't been to yet that I really like to go to <breath> ah Black axe mangle is a very exciting looking kabab Turkish restaurant but done by a proper chef who used to be at noma <breath> uh it's quite odd that it's quite <breath> uh posh food but then it's done <breath> in a restaurant that constantly plates heavy metal <breath> um <breath> so I'd quite like to go there but they only have tables for about 20 people <breath> um so that's my list of places I would like to go to <breath> in terms of my favorite cuisine uh again I'm not quite sure I just quite like things that are <breath> new <breath> I spend a lot of time on Instagram scrolling through looking at food finding new food to eat <breath> I saw a recipe recently uh in the Guardian <breath> uh from Osalangi <breath> for a <breath> choco <breath> <breath> flan where you put in <breath> the cake mixture first and then the custard for the flan And then in the oven <breath> they swap places So you end up with the flan on the top and the cake on the bottom which I think is really interesting And I just kind of want to make it just want to see that <breath> um <breath> so yeah <breath> what brings me to London Well I grew up here I grew up in North London and muzzler Hill and I went to school there <breath> I then left for a couple of years to go to uni and then very quickly decided that <breath> I probably wanted to do the rest of my studies and working in London <breath> So now I'm doing my PhD ucl at in neuroscience <breath> uh and I've stayed in London ever since But at the start of next year in 2020 <breath> I'm uh going to be moving to Edinburgh for a couple of months to work with my industry partner for my PhD where <breath> uh we will be developing the app for my project So <breath> um that'll be really exciting And I think Edinburgh looks like a really amazing city <breath> I tend to prefer to live in cities rather than smaller places I think <breath> just having grown up with having everything within arm's length and always open <breath> I think it'd be quite odd going somewhere where <breath> you kind of have to do everything between nine and five <breath> um I think be a bit depressing Also I don't drive which is definitely a very North London thing <breath> So I would find it quite hard to leave a city But I'm very excited about moving to Edinburgh for a short period of time <breath> What are some of the things I like about London Well I've already listed a few I <breath> uh think there's just so much to do in London and it's just so <breath> cultural and there's great food as I have mentioned at some length <breath> um <breath> so yes I definitely find it hard to leave London What do I not like about London I <breath> uh think some of the things that other people don't like about London in saying that London are quite cold they can be quite harsh <breath> and unfriendly place I quite like that I quite like the anonymity that you have living in a big city <breath> um <breath> I'm not sure what I don't like about London <breath> Maybe I'll find out after I moved to Edinburgh and realize that it's a lot better uh I <breath> Have been to any of the parks in London I have been to some of the parks in London <breath> I uh quite like St james's park I think it's quite nice <breath> um I like the <breath> terrapins and the pelicans that they have there which I think is quite fun <breath> I grew up next to alexandra Park or Alipalley <breath> um which that's just a really nice park A lot of my memories are ah <breath> either going for walks in Alipali with my dog or with friends or <breath> I don't know being a teenager
