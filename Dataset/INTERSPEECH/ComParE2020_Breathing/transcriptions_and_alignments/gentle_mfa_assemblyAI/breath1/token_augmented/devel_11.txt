<disfl.uh> so i came to london because i decided to study abroad in my junior spring semester <breath> i <disfl.uh> chose london out of all the cities in the world because i've actually never been to europe or the uk <breath> <disfl.um> so i was really intrigued and interested in life was in london the culture in london and just i felt that there a lot of things to <breath> like look at and also explore about in london so i chose london as my final destination <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> ucl was one of my top choices for schools to study at because <breath> <disfl.uh> i looked at a lot of schools around the area as well <breath> but my school back home is in a suburban rural area and i also kind of grown up in like a suburban neighborhood and i really wanted to experience what it was like living in a city and i thought that <breath> studying abroad during this time would be really great and i also enjoyed that ucl although it was in the center of london had its own campus which is something that i look very strongly in for schools which also decided my school back home as well <breath> <disfl.um> i've only been in london for about two weeks but i really like how accessible everything in london is <breath> <disfl.um> like things are like a few minutes walk here or a few minutes walk there <breath> and it's really great because it gets me to exercise as well which i would have never done <breath> back home at my school or anywhere in general to be honest <breath> i <disfl.um> also really like how there's a variety of cuisines at london and i can really find restaurants <breath> <disfl.um> from all over the place like here which are close in proximity or just like right next door to each other which i think is a great way to really try foods from other countries and also just kind of explore the culture of london and uk itself <breath> <disfl.um> another thing i like about london is how all the museums are free most museums are free <disfl.um> i haven't gone to all of them yet but i've gone to some <breath> and i think it's a really great way to learn about history and a really exciting way as well <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> some things i do not like about london i feel like this is not like specific to london <breath> but i don't like how early the sun sets <breath> it's kind of sad when i look out the classroom at like 30 04 p m and it's super dark outside and sometimes i have events that happen at like 06 00 p m <breath> and walking in the wind and rain but it's definitely better than walking in the wind and rain at rochester <breath> so i guess it's <breath> not that i don't like it it's <breath> just not something i look forward to <disfl.um> <breath> i think another thing that i don't like about london it might be just because i'm not used to it <breath> but <breath> the crossing at london some people just go at streets <breath> so <breath> i feel like i'm like too scared sometimes i'll put a foot down and then i see that there's no cars and i'll try to go <breath> but then i get scared and i go back to the sidewalk and i wait until super long until the light changes sometimes i feel bad because everyone else is gone and i'm just there so i think that's just something i have to get used to <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> do i have a favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath> yes i do it actually recently opened up the restaurant opened up near me at my hometown it's called hi de la it's a chinese hot pot place <breath> and it actually is available in london in piccadilly circus and i saw it the other day <breath> when i went with friends to just walk around so i'm very excited that there's something i'm familiar with and i can go back and try because it's a really good hot hot place i really recommend it <breath> <disfl.um> have i been to any of the parks in london <breath> i actually haven't gone to any parks in london yet or any of the big parks <breath> i mean i've walked around some parks but i never went in i think that's definitely something i have to do because <breath> where i come from parks really aren't a thing we have like one state park near my house <breath> rochester caused quite a bit of parks as well i just haven't gone which is probably something i should do there as well <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if i met someone new so
