<disfl.um> <breath> so i'm going to talk about my favorite subject which is london <breath> <disfl.um> i was born in london in london bridge <disfl.um> so i'm one of the few <breath> <disfl.uh> real londoners <disfl.um> and you'll notice this at christmas when <disfl.uh> london's empty because everybody goes back to the surrey or wherever they're from and <disfl.uh> they leave london to the real londoner so it's the best time to go out drinking or go to a restaurant and stuff because there's no one around <disfl.um> over christmas we normally go to <breath> a pub in cherry cross road <breath> <disfl.um> and it's one of the only ones that are hope open between christmas and new year and a <disfl.um> they have great drag show there <breath> so we normally go there and then we go to the waffles shop after in <disfl.uh> near old compton street and have waffles and stuff <breath> but <disfl.um> i've lived in london my whole life and it's my favorite place in the world <disfl.uh> even though i'm a bit biased <breath> <disfl.um> one of the things i love about it is even during this time of <breath> <disfl.uh> populism and right wing we're still kind of <breath> liberal and we celebrate difference and we celebrate different cultures and foods and music <breath> and people and places and stuff like that and <breath> that's one of the reasons why i'm so proud of <disfl.uh> being from london <breath> my family have lived in the same area <breath> for about 300 years <breath> we can trace back <breath> <disfl.um> and unfortunately i'm the last person of my family <breath> to live <disfl.uh> in the era so <breath> <disfl.um> unless i have children that would be our family name that's dead in <disfl.um> that area she's quite sad but <breath> i live in the bermans era of london which was when i was a kid it was <breath> still quite <breath> <disfl.uh> post industrial <breath> there was empty factories and it was kind of run down there wasn't much development <breath> <disfl.um> and it was kind of dark and run down but <breath> in some ways <disfl.uh> i and <breath> missed that it's quite interesting that we're nostalgic about the things that were <breath> quite bad for us <breath> <disfl.um> a it's changed quite lot in the recent times <breath> there's new buildings and <breath> coffee shops and new people but it's hard to not feel or that it's lost its soul in some <disfl.uh> way <breath> and <disfl.um> i think it's a double edged sword i like that there's <breath> new developments but <breath> <disfl.um> i just wish that they would leave some of the stuff <breath> for the people that live around there the lawn dress and the pubs and stuff like that <breath> were the social places of the area that <breath> kind of disappearing <disfl.ah> now <breath> <disfl.um> i've lived in lots of places all over the world but i've always kept my flat in london so that i can come home whenever i want lived in new york for a bit <breath> which was kind of like london on the steroids but super neurotic city people shouting at each other lived <breath> <disfl.uh> in sydney for a bit melbourne south africa south america lived in africa for little bits of time <breath> <disfl.um> but there's no place like london <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> so i'd like to stay at you still if i can when i finish phd my because <disfl.uh> i don't really want to move away <disfl.um> seems to be a common problem <breath> in academia is that there's fewer and fewer jobs <breath> <disfl.uh> as sort of the academics work well into their eighty s and stuff and for the young people coming up <breath> there's less and less jobs in research and especially <disfl.um> jobs in london and academics are forced to move all over the world to get work so i'm <disfl.uh> not really sure what the solution is but going i'm to try my best to stay in london <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> for that <disfl.uh> <breath> the icm has got lots of interesting people <breath> doing <disfl.um> interesting projects my own project is <disfl.um> <breath> about <disfl.uh> what happens to your sleep structure when you lose your vision <breath> <disfl.um> so there's <breath> different eye diseases affect different parts of the eye some diseases affect the image forming layers of the ire <disfl.uh> other diseases affect <breath> the retinal gangling layer which <disfl.um> <breath> is the resting place for these certain class of cells which tell the brain when it's daytime or when it's nighttime <breath> <disfl.um> and in certain blind paint
