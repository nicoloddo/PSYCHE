<disfl.um> i don't live too far from london in general <disfl.um> i just live about 20 minutes away <breath> and <disfl.um> the reason why i did come to london is because i studied at ucl <disfl.um> and i studied history and philosophy of science <breath> <disfl.um> i've just graduated now and i'm looking for a graduate job in london <disfl.um> so i think that's basically what brings me to london <breath> <disfl.um> i what like about london is that it's a very fast paced city <breath> <disfl.um> there's lots to do there's lots of interesting people there's some cool clubs and some cool bars <breath> <breath> <breath> <disfl.um> i think it's a city with a lot of opportunities and i think i've appreciated that more when <breath> you meet people that are moving to london for the first time and <disfl.um> you kind of get to know <breath> their backgrounds and the lack of opportunities available in their cities so <disfl.um> yeah that's <breath> pretty much the things i think i like <breath> about in london in general <disfl.um> <breath> i don't like how london is very touristy <breath> <disfl.um> sometimes it can be really frustrating especially around the most touristy areas <disfl.um> <breath> the london transport system for example is not designed to handle the influx of tourists so <breath> times can be quite busy and <disfl.um> yeah it's just a bit frustrating in that sense <breath> <disfl.um> it's also quite an expensive city i think in terms of rent which makes it quite hard for people to move in and find a job that pays enough <breath> to pay rent and so on and so forth <disfl.um> <breath> and <breath> perhaps <breath> there's too much happening in london there's too much things closing down <breath> so there's lots of bars and clubs closing down recently which has been quite frustrating <breath> <disfl.um> and they've been opening up new properties as a result <breath> which has been a bit annoying <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah i think i like indian and turkish food <breath> probably because that's my background <breath> <disfl.um> i quite like to go to nando's which is a bit of a cliche but i've always gone as a child so it has a special place in my heart <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i have been to almost all the parks in london <disfl.um> i think my favorite definitely has to be hampstead heath <breath> it's a little bit away <breath> from the touristy parts which is quite nice because it's usually local people that go to hamster heath are not tourists <breath> which is nice because there's lots of space and it doesn't feel too busy <disfl.um> so you can really enjoy yourself there and have a good time <breath> relax have a picnic and just relax with friends in the summer it's really cool <breath> they also have some swimming pools as well where you can go like swimming <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and i think it's quite a nice park in general <breath> <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i think if there was someone new i would recommend that they would obviously have to do all the parks i think it's really cool i think perhaps <breath> yeah parks would be quite cool <disfl.um> <breath> not get fish and chips i'd recommend there's so many different restaurants in london so i would recommend trying as many cuisines as possible <breath> <disfl.um> and not just sticking to british food because i think british food is quite rubbish in general <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i would recommend definitely going to the nightclubs we have some really famous nightclubs in london like fabric and miniature sound and egg <breath> <disfl.um> and i recommend you at least do one of these before you leave london because <breath> these clubs have been around for quite some time <breath> we have some really cool bars <disfl.um> oxford street is quite cool i guess as a tourist <disfl.um> perhaps going to some shopping malls and <breath> checking the art galleries that would be quite cool i think <disfl.um> <breath> i think what i quite like doing is <breath> going to kind of <breath> places that not many people visit so <breath> i just like going to galleries that are not as well known <disfl.um> and perhaps just escaping central london so perhaps going to like <breath> zone four zone five zone six and some there's actually quite cool things to do there i think <disfl.um> <breath> in terms of tourists
