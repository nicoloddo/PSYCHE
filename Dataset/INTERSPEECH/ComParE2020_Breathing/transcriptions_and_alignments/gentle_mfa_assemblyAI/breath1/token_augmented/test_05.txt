i first came to london to start my msc and then to do my phd because i really wanted to work with someone here at ucl <breath> <disfl.um> so i moved to london but it's not actually somewhere i ever wanted to move <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> at first i found it really big <disfl.um> because i grew up in quite small cities <breath> <disfl.um> and things take things a really long time to get to places but actually as i've lived here <breath> <disfl.um> i've enjoyed it a lot more <disfl.um> <breath> yeah i've found public transport here is really good generally <breath> <disfl.um> but once i started cycling in london that was really great <breath> <disfl.um> because it's a lot faster to get to different places <breath> <disfl.um> and there are some really good cycle routes to and from <breath> work for me <breath> <disfl.um> i find it a bit more scary to cycle on routes that i don't know because there's a lot of traffic <breath> <disfl.um> but it's generally really good <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and good to get some exercise <breath> <disfl.uh> i also quite like traveling on the bus rather than on the tube <breath> <disfl.ah> because it's much nicer to be above ground than underground <breath> <disfl.um> and it's also really noisy on the tube <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i <breath> don't really have a favorite restaurant in london <breath> <disfl.um> but <breath> there are some really nice ones <breath> <breath> particularly ethiopian <disfl.um> food which i'm going to tonight i'm looking forward to <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah there are lots of different styles of food <breath> <disfl.um> we also like to go to a fish and chip place quite near us that has <breath> really good quality fish and also great haloumi <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> which is really good <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah <breath> i really like the area of london that i'm in <breath> i think my favorite bit is hampstead heath and <disfl.um> going to places like kenwood house <breath> because you can sort of escape london a little bit <breath> and get to somewhere a bit quieter <breath> and there are really great views of london from there that <breath> <disfl.um> if you climb up the hill <disfl.um> especially in the evening <breath> it's really nice to climb up the hill and just look over the city when the lights go on <breath> <disfl.um> really good views and actually from the top of hampstead heath as well there's <breath> great <disfl.um> panoramas of all of the city but you feel nicely removed from the city <breath> <disfl.um> which is really good and <breath> also at kenwood house they have really good tea and scones <breath> <disfl.um> and yeah it's just a really nice place to walk <breath> and see <disfl.um> lots of people with their dogs <disfl.um> and they have good lakes there as well <breath> and places that you can swim in well some people swim there all year round <breath> <disfl.uh> which seems a bit mad <breath> and freezing cold i swam there once in the summer on a boiling hot day in the middle of a very hot summer <breath> and it was so cold my hands sort of cramped <disfl.um> up <breath> <disfl.um> so i don't know quite how they manage it in the middle of winter <breath> <disfl.uh> but there are people who swim in sort of the open ponds <breath> all year round <disfl.um> but it does get really busy in the summer particularly when it's hot <breath> and that's a really fun thing to do in london <breath> so that's definitely the place i take visitors when they come and see me <breath> in london is actually not to the <breath> sort of classic sites like the london eye or <breath> <disfl.um> anything really in the center <breath> <disfl.uh> maybe because lots of my friends aren't massively keen on big cities or loads of people <breath> <disfl.um> so we tend to go walking instead <breath> <disfl.uh> in places that are a little bit quieter
