m <breath> i came to london about six years ago to study <breath> i had finished my high school studies and i wanted to come to university <breath> so i did two years of what they call six form here <breath> in which i did math physics and economics <breath> after that i went to university in another part of london in another part of england <breath> and so i left london for a few years <breath> and then now i've come back <breath> to work and to finish up my studies <breath> one of the things the few things that i do like about london is the level of diversity that london brings <breath> london is a melting pot with people from different cultures from different countries <breath> and funny things everything works here in london people get along with each other <breath> there's a sense of community and there's a sense of understanding even though <breath> people are probably not going to talk to you in the streets <breath> but if you need help <breath> there's a high chance that they will help you <breath> and <breath> i just really love that sense of spirit and that sense of understanding <breath> <disfl.um> and some of the things i do not like about london is it is just too expensive <breath> the city is so <breath> expensive it feels like every time i breathe there's money coming out of my pocket going on an account <breath> it is not the best <breath> <disfl.um> another thing that i do not like about london is when traveling on the tube during peak times or rush hour it's just so full people have barely time people can barely breathe <breath> <disfl.um> but then again it ties back to the understanding that everyone understands that this is what you have to go through to live in this wonderful city <breath> <breath> so one of my favorite restaurants in london would have to be benihana <breath> <disfl.um> they have three locations in st paul's piccadilly and in chelsea <breath> i love benihana because it's japanese food and i absolutely love japanese food <breath> the seasoning the fresh fish the sushi the beef the teriyaki sauce <breath> is just absolutely amazing it's everything i could eat it every day <breath> but obviously it's too expensive so i can't <breath> and <breath> when it comes to parks in london i haven't been to that many parks in london i've been to hyde park <breath> and i've been to regents park <breath> and these are really nice parks during the summer you can sit down and have a meal or just look at the view and just take it all in so it's a really great experience <disfl.um> between the two <breath> i think i would probably go for hyde park just because you can get to harrods <breath> quite <breath> fast i think you get to <breath> harris from regent park as well <breath> <disfl.um> yeah i've never done it but i think you should be able to because they're quite close to each other <disfl.um> so if someone you came to london and had to recommend <breath> somewhere <disfl.um> for them to <breath> go wow i would probably recommend <breath> the tourist attractions such as <disfl.um> buckingham palace and big ben obviously hyde park <breath> <disfl.um> just for them to be london eye the shard <breath> just for them to kind of see london from a tourist perspective and to experience the culture that <breath> london has to offer i'd also take some to you know some of the <breath> not so touristy parts but parts that have such great street food <breath> such as an area shortage hackney or i should have a canary wolf as well because that's really really nice it's like the business district of london where all the big <breath> some of the big corporations and some of the big banks are located <breath> and <breath> i haven't been to <breath> that many notorious attractions myself <breath> in london just because i don't know i feel like when you live here you always have this thing at the back of your head that i could always go so i bother go today <breath> but i haven't been to any but
