so i'm a very big fan of restaurants especially in london i think one of my favorite things is going to new restaurants and i read a lot of restaurant reviews to find out restaurants to go to <breath> i'm quite proud of the fact that i often tend to be the person to pick restaurants i go to friends <breath> i <disfl.uh> think i have quite good taste in restaurants <breath> so in terms of a favorite restaurant <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i would say that <breath> i would prefer going to a new restaurant to restaurant one that i've already been to but some very old reliable ones <breath> i quite like caravan which is a very nice chain of restaurants around london there's one in bankside there's one in king's cross <breath> and <disfl.uh> they do really good sharing plate type food <breath> of restaurants i haven't been to yet that i really like to go to <breath> <disfl.ah> black axe mangle is a very exciting looking kabab turkish restaurant but done by a proper chef who used to be at noma <breath> <disfl.uh> it's quite odd that it's quite <breath> <disfl.uh> posh food but then it's done <breath> in a restaurant that constantly plates heavy metal <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so i'd quite like to go there but they only have tables for about 20 people <breath> <disfl.um> so that's my list of places i would like to go to <breath> in terms of my favorite cuisine <disfl.uh> again i'm not quite sure i just quite like things that are <breath> new <breath> i spend a lot of time on instagram scrolling through looking at food finding new food to eat <breath> i saw a recipe recently <disfl.uh> in the guardian <breath> <disfl.uh> from osalangi <breath> for a <breath> choco <breath> <breath> flan where you put in <breath> the cake mixture first and then the custard for the flan and then in the oven <breath> they swap places so you end up with the flan on the top and the cake on the bottom which i think is really interesting and i just kind of want to make it just want to see that <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so yeah <breath> what brings me to london well i grew up here i grew up in north london and muzzler hill and i went to school there <breath> i then left for a couple of years to go to uni and then very quickly decided that <breath> i probably wanted to do the rest of my studies and working in london <breath> so now i'm doing my phd ucl at in neuroscience <breath> <disfl.uh> and i've stayed in london ever since but at the start of next year in 2020 <breath> i'm <disfl.uh> going to be moving to edinburgh for a couple of months to work with my industry partner for my phd where <breath> <disfl.uh> we will be developing the app for my project so <breath> <disfl.um> that'll be really exciting and i think edinburgh looks like a really amazing city <breath> i tend to prefer to live in cities rather than smaller places i think <breath> just having grown up with having everything within arm's length and always open <breath> i think it'd be quite odd going somewhere where <breath> you kind of have to do everything between nine and five <breath> <disfl.um> i think be a bit depressing also i don't drive which is definitely a very north london thing <breath> so i would find it quite hard to leave a city but i'm very excited about moving to edinburgh for a short period of time <breath> what are some of the things i like about london well i've already listed a few i <breath> <disfl.uh> think there's just so much to do in london and it's just so <breath> cultural and there's great food as i have mentioned at some length <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so yes i definitely find it hard to leave london what do i not like about london i <breath> <disfl.uh> think some of the things that other people don't like about london in saying that london are quite cold they can be quite harsh <breath> and unfriendly place i quite like that i quite like the anonymity that you have living in a big city <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i'm not sure what i don't like about london <breath> maybe i'll find out after i moved to edinburgh and realize that it's a lot better <disfl.uh> i <breath> have been to any of the parks in london i have been to some of the parks in london <breath> i <disfl.uh> quite like st james's park i think it's quite nice <breath> <disfl.um> i like the <breath> terrapins and the pelicans that they have there which i think is quite fun <breath> i grew up next to alexandra park or alipalley <breath> <disfl.um> which that's just a really nice park a lot of my memories are <disfl.ah> <breath> either going for walks in alipali with my dog or with friends or <breath> i don't know being a teenager
