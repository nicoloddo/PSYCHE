well i'm in london because primarily that's where my work is i am working at the ucl ear institute which is on grey's inn road near kings cross <breath> <breath> but i've lived in london previously as well so i <breath> used to work in finance and <breath> i moved here for the first time in 2001 after finishing university <breath> i live mostly in around south london so it was initially in <disfl.uh> eastullage then in clapham <breath> and then in kennington <breath> so at the moment i'm living in oxford and i'm down in london usually three or four days a week <breath> mostly just coming down into paddington or into marybone and getting the tube across to king's cross <disfl.um> but i do have various groups of friends here who i don't see as often as i would like to <breath> <disfl.um> but when i do then i'll <breath> tend to go down to central <disfl.uh> london or over to <breath> <disfl.um> victoria where quite a few of my friends work or maybe go and stay with friends <breath> in kennington <breath> when i'm in london though <breath> <disfl.um> i've got fond memories of london as well from those previous times <breath> my brother used to live in east london and quite a few of his friends are still m in that area so <breath> i see them fairly often <breath> and <disfl.uh> quite often end up going to concerts in london sometimes with my dad who's also <disfl.uh> interested in music and <breath> sings and so we'll go to chamber music concerts for example <breath> some of the things i like about london <breath> are the fact that it's got this very rich history <breath> <disfl.uh> and there's signs of that all over the place <breath> there are different levels of london being <disfl.um> built on top of one another <breath> so there are glimpses of those lower levels or those earlier levels if you look hard enough <breath> and <disfl.uh> i do like the cosmopolitan nature of the city <breath> the diversity of the people here <breath> the different languages you can hear spoken and the different cuisines that you can find and <disfl.um> <breath> the fact that there's always somewhere new to explore so there'll always be <breath> whether it's another museum or another restaurant or <breath> another neighborhood <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i also like to just get on a bus and sit at the front at the top <breath> and look above the shop front level and look at the roofs of the buildings <breath> <disfl.um> which again can <disfl.uh> reveal some of london's history <breath> things i don't like so much about london include <disfl.um> <breath> the <breath> rickety nature of some of the infrastructure the heat on the underground <disfl.um> <breath> and although i engage in this behavior myself the fact that it is <breath> sometimes quite <breath> isolated people do their own thing you get on the tube and <breath> there's not much eye contact i don't really notice it too much when i'm in london but when i'm away from london <breath> i'm more aware of what london misses from that perspective <breath> <disfl.um> other things i don't like about london i'm going to move on to the next question actually so do i have a favorite restaurant or cuisine and is it available in london <breath> i <breath> don't think i have a particular favorite <breath> i <disfl.uh> do enjoy chinese food having lived in china for a while and <breath> <disfl.um> there's plenty of chinese food here in london <breath> <disfl.um> whether you're in chinatown soho area or elsewhere <breath> i've got fond memories of a greek cypriot restaurant in clapham north <breath> which had wonderful <disfl.uh> mezze and <breath> great bread that they used to make there <breath> and <breath> also <disfl.um> i enjoy that because it reminds me of times <disfl.uh> when i've been in greece <disfl.uh> for example in cretor <breath> <breath> i had a good holiday in thessaloniki <breath> have i been to any of the parks here in london well <breath> i <disfl.uh> have been to several of them <breath> i don't spend as much time in the big central ones like high park green park and st james's park but there are some nice open spaces elsewhere <disfl.um> <breath> when i was living in delhi <breath> in fact maybe this isn't a park but
