so i moved to london because my partner is studying at university of college london he is working on getting his phd in cognitive neuroscience <breath> and we decided that it would be fun if i moved here as well <breath> so i came from the united states <breath> and i have been living here now since <breath> the 29 january 2019 <breath> so almost full year <breath> <disfl.um> it's been a very exciting journey <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> it took me <breath> approximately eight or nine months <breath> to be able to make the move happen <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i worked as a nurse back home <breath> <disfl.um> for almost two years <breath> and i had to <breath> go through an entire process to <breath> get my nursing license and my visa in order <breath> and now i work here <breath> <disfl.um> in reading as a nurse <breath> i work on a diabetes <breath> rheumatology ward <breath> which is <disfl.um> very different than the nursing i used to do <breath> i was previously a nurse in the intensive care unit <breath> and often worked with <breath> patients after cardiac surgeries <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> ear nose and throat surgeries <breath> as well as various medical conditions like respiratory failure <breath> and now i'm dealing primarily with <breath> medical patients who are generally not as sick <breath> and <disfl.um> <breath> my patient workload is much larger as well <breath> i was previously only working with <breath> two to three patients and now i work with an average of <breath> eight to ten patients <breath> which is quite a large difference <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so it was a very large adjustment period when i first came here <breath> i had to <breath> adjust first of all just to having more patients <breath> <disfl.um> so there's a lot of prioritization and <breath> <disfl.uh> delegation that i needed to quickly learn in order to <breath> be efficient and practice safe <breath> <disfl.uh> nursing care <breath> <disfl.um> but luckily i have been working with a great team <breath> and the team that i work with are from several different countries the nhs is currently having a massive nursing shortage so <breath> they often bring in nurses from the eu <breath> as well as other countries <breath> <breath> the agency i went through is <breath> <disfl.um> actually based in the philippines <breath> and so <breath> there is a large philippine <breath> population at our hospital <breath> <disfl.um> as well as people from spain portugal <breath> <disfl.um> all over africa <breath> and america surprisingly as <breath> i have yet to meet another american nurse <breath> <disfl.um> but that's all right <breath> <disfl.ah> so it's been <breath> it's been fun getting to know everyone from all these different countries <breath> and to have people with sort of a similar experience <breath> so <disfl.um> <breath> that definitely helped with my transition period <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and now they are great friends <breath> and <breath> <breath> recently <disfl.um> i got to experience what the nhs <breath> is like as a patient because i had <breath> a very severe chest infection and <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i had to go in an e <breath> and for <disfl.um> a temperature of 40 <breath> and my heart rate was over 130 <breath> and they nearly admitted me to the hospital but luckily <breath> i got a little better with some fluids and <breath> iv antibiotics <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but <breath> it <breath> was very <disfl.um> interesting because <breath> of <breath> i had never even seen my vp <breath> yet let alone go to ame so i was messaging <breath> all my coworkers all my friends trying to figure out what to do <breath> and they were a great support system during that time which was really nice <breath> and it was actually quite a good experience apart from
