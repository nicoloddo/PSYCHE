data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_0-14.wav|so <disfl.um> my name is jamel and i've lived in london my whole life <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_111-122.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> you have the bikes in london which there isn't <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_122-136.wav|<breath> much in those rural areas as well but there are starting to be <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_136-156.wav|<breath> built out and i guess my favorite restaurant used <breath> <disfl.um> nando's to be but it's now more <disfl.um> <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_14-27.wav|<breath> my favorite thing about london are the museums and all of the <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_156-182.wav|<breath> i do like a buffet that there is quite near my neighborhood so they serve lots of different types of food so they serve pizza <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_182-209.wav|<breath> and <breath> my favorite food would be <breath> <disfl.um> indian food to be honest like curry so it would be the curry and the chicken lamb <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_209-223.wav|<breath> and the different types of rice and <breath> spices that they have which <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_223-248.wav|<breath> i do know some of the names and so they have potatoes and stuff and stuff like that as well so they have pompedoms <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_248-265.wav|<breath> which is something nice nothing nice which gods of <breath> the indian being my favorite food <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_265-281.wav|<breath> and yeah but i guess in london there isn't really too many indian places that <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_27-55.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> community centers and all the activities that you can do around there all the pubs and the clubs i guess <disfl.uh> my favorite area would be <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_281-290.wav|<breath> i <disfl.um> would go to <breath> to eat <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_290-303.wav|<breath> and so <disfl.um> my favorite places would be close to my home <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_303-315.wav|<breath> in that regard and <disfl.um> i guess i went to university <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_315-331.wav|<breath> in london and so while i was there i was imperial in south kensington so <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_331-341.wav|<breath> that's another reason why south is a favorite area <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_341-350.wav|<breath> of mine and then we have the <disfl.um> <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_350-363.wav|<breath> i was doing <disfl.um> <breath> medicine so when i was studying medicine <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_363-372.wav|<breath> i <disfl.um> only done basically the first year <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_372-383.wav|<breath> and so now i decided to work still in london <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_383-393.wav|<breath> but <disfl.um> i was always interested in doing research <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_393-402.wav|<breath> i was interested in research like becoming a <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_402-415.wav|<breath> therapist a psychiatrist <breath> but i guess i was always thinking that <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_415-433.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> i wasn't really into the surgical aspects of medicine and so we obviously had to do <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_433-451.wav|<breath> every everything we were learning the course but i wasn't really into cutting the bodies and doing <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_451-472.wav|<breath> some of that stuff so i thought i can find a different path <breath> and i have felt like <disfl.um> <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_472-488.wav|<breath> it'd be easy for me to start working now and maybe go back to university <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_488-494.wav|<breath> later on <breath> and so <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_494-506.wav|<breath> i might go to improve there's lots of <disfl.um> different courses <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_506-528.wav|<breath> that do offer similar things i guess i would still want to stay in london if i go to university <disfl.um> <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_528-550.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i guess <breath> <breath> the idea of going to a place outside of london to like a more rural area <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_55-69.wav|<breath> south kensington <breath> <disfl.um> around there at night's bridge they have lots of <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_550-565.wav|<breath> wouldn't be too <breath> enticing for me because i guess i had most <disfl.um> <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_565-579.wav|<breath> of my school and earlier on <breath> done in a more rural setting <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_579-594.wav|<breath> than <disfl.um> london would be and obviously i like the fact that it's near <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_594-613.wav|<breath> lots of <disfl.um> different places <breath> <disfl.uh> different types of restaurants and stuff like that and i <disfl.um> <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_613-620.wav|<breath> guess in london the best things <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_620-630.wav|<breath> usually are kind of just like in the center <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_630-643.wav|<breath> to where they have all the different museums like in lechester square <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_69-77.wav|<breath> of <breath> nice <disfl.um> european food <disfl.um> <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_77-96.wav|<breath> they have a taco bell there are things that you don't really get in other places in london <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_00_96-111.wav|<breath> i guess compared to where i live <breath> <disfl.um> there's nicer parks as well <breath>|0
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_0-28.wav|well i'm in london because primarily that's where my work is i am working at the ucl ear institute which is on grey's inn road near kings cross <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_104-143.wav|<breath> mostly just coming down into paddington or into marybone and getting the tube across to king's cross <disfl.um> but i do have various groups of friends here who i don't see as often as i would like to <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_143-163.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but when i do then i'll <breath> tend to go down to central <disfl.uh> london or over to <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_163-181.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> victoria where quite a few of my friends work or maybe go and stay with friends <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_181-204.wav|<breath> in kennington <breath> when i'm in london though <breath> <disfl.um> i've got fond memories of london as well from those previous times <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_204-227.wav|<breath> my brother used to live in east london and quite a few of his friends are still m in that area so <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_227-256.wav|<breath> i see them fairly often <breath> and <disfl.uh> quite often end up going to concerts in london sometimes with my dad who's also <disfl.uh> interested in music and <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_256-268.wav|<breath> sings and so we'll go to chamber music concerts for example <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_268-288.wav|<breath> some of the things i like about london <breath> are the fact that it's got this very rich history <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_28-40.wav|<breath> <breath> but i've lived in london previously as well so i <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_288-314.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> and there's signs of that all over the place <breath> there are different levels of london being <disfl.um> built on top of one another <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_314-332.wav|<breath> so there are glimpses of those lower levels or those earlier levels if you look hard enough <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_332-344.wav|<breath> and <disfl.uh> i do like the cosmopolitan nature of the city <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_344-369.wav|<breath> the diversity of the people here <breath> the different languages you can hear spoken and the different cuisines that you can find and <disfl.um> <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_369-392.wav|<breath> the fact that there's always somewhere new to explore so there'll always be <breath> whether it's another museum or another restaurant or <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_392-415.wav|<breath> another neighborhood <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i also like to just get on a bus and sit at the front at the top <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_40-60.wav|<breath> used to work in finance and <breath> i moved here for the first time in 2001 after finishing university <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_415-431.wav|<breath> and look above the shop front level and look at the roofs of the buildings <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_431-442.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> which again can <disfl.uh> reveal some of london's history <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_442-453.wav|<breath> things i don't like so much about london include <disfl.um> <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_453-469.wav|<breath> the <breath> rickety nature of some of the infrastructure the heat on the underground <disfl.um> <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_469-483.wav|<breath> and although i engage in this behavior myself the fact that it is <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_483-499.wav|<breath> sometimes quite <breath> isolated people do their own thing you get on the tube and <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_499-522.wav|<breath> there's not much eye contact i don't really notice it too much when i'm in london but when i'm away from london <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_522-533.wav|<breath> i'm more aware of what london misses from that perspective <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_533-567.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> other things i don't like about london i'm going to move on to the next question actually so do i have a favorite restaurant or cuisine and is it available in london <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_567-577.wav|<breath> i <breath> don't think i have a particular favorite <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_577-592.wav|<breath> i <disfl.uh> do enjoy chinese food having lived in china for a while and <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_592-612.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> there's plenty of chinese food here in london <breath> <disfl.um> whether you're in chinatown soho area or elsewhere <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_60-78.wav|<breath> i live mostly in around south london so it was initially in <disfl.uh> eastullage then in clapham <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_612-625.wav|<breath> i've got fond memories of a greek cypriot restaurant in clapham north <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_625-641.wav|<breath> which had wonderful <disfl.uh> mezze and <breath> great bread that they used to make there <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_641-666.wav|<breath> and <breath> also <disfl.um> i enjoy that because it reminds me of times <disfl.uh> when i've been in greece <disfl.uh> for example in cretor <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_666-675.wav|<breath> <breath> i had a good holiday in thessaloniki <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_675-697.wav|<breath> have i been to any of the parks here in london well <breath> i <disfl.uh> have been to several of them <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_697-727.wav|<breath> i don't spend as much time in the big central ones like high park green park and st james's park but there are some nice open spaces elsewhere <disfl.um> <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_01_78-104.wav|<breath> and then in kennington <breath> so at the moment i'm living in oxford and i'm down in london usually three or four days a week <breath>|1
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_0-19.wav|so i moved to london just over a year ago now to start a post doc job at ucl <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_121-155.wav|<breath> and that was kind of my <breath> experience of london of being disoriented and lost and i don't think it really helped that i spent a lot of time in the slightly like <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_155-177.wav|<breath> less nice parts of london <breath> because a lot of my friends moved here after we finished undergraduate <disfl.um> and obviously <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_177-202.wav|<breath> no one really had any money and a lot of them were still doing further study and stuff so they kind of lived in <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_19-48.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i guess i applied for a few different jobs and this is the one i got i initially wasn't that sure about moving to london because <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_202-210.wav|<breath> miles away parts of london <disfl.um> like <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_210-231.wav|<breath> i guess berman z or <breath> <disfl.uh> shepherd's bush market and stuff and so i'd spend a lot of time <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_231-270.wav|<breath> traveling just to get from one place to another or you'd go out with some friends and then you'd have to get like four night buses back <disfl.um> to someone's flat where you could stay for the night <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_270-288.wav|<breath> or waiting for the bus <disfl.um> <breath> back to oxford where i was living at the time <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_288-303.wav|<breath> at sort 03 of 00 in the morning from like notting hill <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_303-328.wav|<breath> and that's kind of intimidating and so i think i always got this impression of london as kind of quite cold and unfriendly and <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_328-361.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> also somewhere where it's really inconvenient to get anywhere <breath> but i think actually just that at the time a lot of the people i knew lived in inconvenient places and <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_361-376.wav|<breath> well i guess that's obviously <breath> makes sense when you consider their students but <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_376-419.wav|<breath> most of london's not really like that <breath> and there are parts of london that even though they're cheaper they're also a lot nicer and easier to get around to whereas i would not say west london is particularly always like that <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_419-440.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i think some of the things i like most about london are just that there's always something going on <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_440-458.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> there's always like a museum or an art gallery or a show that you've not seen <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_458-470.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and it's kind of <breath> nice to be able to <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_470-488.wav|<breath> wake up one morning and not have any plans in particular of what you want to do <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_48-73.wav|<breath> whenever i'd been here before it was often <breath> seen quite big and intimidating and you know when you get the tube and then <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_488-515.wav|<breath> but still be able to find something really interesting that you'll really enjoy <breath> and not have had to plan it weeks or months in advance <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_515-532.wav|<breath> or for it to be like <breath> the same thing that you've done and seen before <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_532-543.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so that's one of the things i really like <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_543-565.wav|<breath> i also kind of like <breath> how i see more of my family than before because they come from near london <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_565-599.wav|<breath> able so they're to visit me more often <breath> <disfl.um> although it does mean that my younger sister kind of tends to turn up and is like <disfl.oh> by the way can i <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_599-619.wav|<breath> stay with you tonight and i'm like yeah sure but <breath> maybe some notice would have been helpful <disfl.um> <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_619-637.wav|<breath> yeah but i guess she's <breath> kind of at that point in her life where she's just <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_637-646.wav|<breath> experimenting and visiting friends and forward planning isn't <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_646-661.wav|<breath> as important to her <breath> <disfl.um> but it is nice even when she just <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_661-680.wav|<breath> turns up unexpectedly even if it's a bit stressful to find somewhere for her to sleep or <disfl.um> <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_680-697.wav|<breath> <breath> i don't know make sure she gets whatever train she needs in the next morning <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_697-713.wav|<breath> it is nice that she feels that she can just turn up and be welcome <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_713-729.wav|<breath> and <disfl.um> i think some of the things i don't really like about london <disfl.uh> <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_729-742.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> how polluted it is i mean you can't really see it <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_73-96.wav|<breath> you come out of the tube and you no idea what direction you're facing or what exit you should go out of <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_742-762.wav|<breath> and i don't think i've actually felt any effects of it but every so often you have these news <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_762-779.wav|<breath> bbc news articles or whatever come out that say the most polluted places in the city <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_779-795.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> bloomsbury is pretty bad central london is pretty bad the tube is really bad <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_795-813.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and whilst you can't see the effect it has on your health you kind of <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_813-829.wav|<breath> worry that maybe it is or maybe it will a few years down the line <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_02_96-121.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and you have to start walking for google maps will even kind of catch up and tell you which direction you're going in <breath>|2
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_0-17.wav|<disfl.uh> so i come from singapore and i came over to london to pursue my undergraduate studies <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_102-120.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> running as well as traveling <disfl.uh> i recently came back from germany and japan i <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_120-135.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> have some family in japan so i go to japan almost every at <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_135-140.wav|<breath> least once a <breath> <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_140-153.wav|<breath> year <disfl.um> the favorite <disfl.um> country that i've been to so far <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_153-177.wav|<breath> i would say or rather the favorite city <breath> that i like <disfl.ah> thus far i think it was to be like tokyo <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_17-38.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> before <breath> <disfl.uh> i lived even though i'm singapore and i've also lived in china and south korea <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_177-189.wav|<breath> because i like how <breath> efficient it is i like how <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_189-204.wav|<breath> transport <disfl.uh> there is so much more convenient and i like how everything opens <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_204-217.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> until really late at night <breath> and so i can still <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_217-230.wav|<breath> get food <breath> when i hang out with my friends really late <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_230-246.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah <disfl.uh> some of the other countries that i really enjoyed visiting includes <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_246-250.wav|<breath> greece <breath> mauritius <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_250-257.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> melbourne <breath> which is part <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_257-262.wav|<breath> of australia <breath> and <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_262-268.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> bali in indonesia <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_268-278.wav|<breath> i think that's because i really like <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_278-287.wav|<breath> the beach and i really like the sea <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_287-308.wav|<breath> and i really like to go south boarding <breath> so that's why i guess i really like <disfl.um> countries with <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_308-316.wav|<breath> beaches and <disfl.um> the seaside in general <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_316-324.wav|<breath> i <disfl.uh> hope to stay in london <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_324-332.wav|<breath> for another <breath> two years <breath> and <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_332-340.wav|<breath> potentially <disfl.um> <breath> move <breath> to canada <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_340-350.wav|<breath> or back to south korea where i once lived <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_350-364.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> i want to move to canada to canada because i really like <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_364-381.wav|<breath> cold winters and i really like the snow <breath> and i just like being around nature <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_38-61.wav|<breath> and before i came over to london <breath> i <disfl.um> studied psychology and angered science and i'm currently in my third year <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_381-401.wav|<breath> so <breath> <disfl.uh> that is one of m one of the big reasons why i want to move there <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_401-415.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> i think london might get a bit too busy for me sometimes <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_415-430.wav|<breath> so and there's <breath> a lot of people so that's why i might not <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_430-460.wav|<breath> generally <disfl.uh> want to live here in the long term <breath> <disfl.uh> south korea is also another option for me because <disfl.uh> i lived there for really long and <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_460-470.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> a lot of my friends are there <breath> <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_470-488.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> and i think i'm also really used to the country so that's also another reason why <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_488-501.wav|<breath> i think i might want to move back to south korea after <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_501-539.wav|<breath> living in london <breath> <disfl.uh> but with that said i really like london a lot i like how diverse this i like how i can meet so many different people here coming from so many different backgrounds <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_61-72.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so upon graduation i hope to pursue msc in <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_72-81.wav|<breath> developmental psychology either at ucl or at kings <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_81-93.wav|<breath> and i hope to be a <disfl.uh> developmental or child psychologist <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_03_93-102.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so some of my hobbies include <breath>|3
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_0-17.wav|<disfl.um> so i moved to london for the first time in 2014 <disfl.uh> for my masters degree <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_102-126.wav|<breath> we like how cosmopolitan it is how you can find things to do <disfl.um> at any time of day in any area <disfl.um> <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_126-136.wav|<breath> we like the range of cultures food <disfl.ah> cinema <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_136-161.wav|<breath> theater all of that <disfl.um> i think it's a really great city and have met a lot of interesting people from around the world <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_161-180.wav|<breath> however sometimes i find london a bit stressful <disfl.um> it feels a bit isolating and dirty rent <disfl.um> <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_17-53.wav|<breath> i studied social policy and development at dallasy <breath> <disfl.um> i was in london for a year but then afterwards moved to frankfurt with my partner <disfl.um> because he got a job there he's german <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_180-191.wav|<breath> is extremely high given how low the salaries are <disfl.um> <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_191-206.wav|<breath> but i still think it's a fun city to be in while you're young <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_206-224.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> particularly what i like about london is the diverse <disfl.uh> culture around cuisines that it has <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_224-247.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> the other day i went to an ethiopian restaurant which i quite liked <disfl.um> i haven't had ethiopian food elsewhere before <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_247-270.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and in particular the cuisine that i think i like most is <disfl.um> indian one of my favorite restaurants is dishum <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_270-317.wav|<breath> i <disfl.um> go there regularly with my partner and a friend of ours we meet there maybe once or twice a month for breakfast on the weekends and it's really nice because it's become part of our routine <disfl.uh> and a place to meet up with friends|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_318-327.wav|and <disfl.um> enjoy a nice meal <breath> <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_327-340.wav|<breath> my favorite parks in london i would say are victoria park <disfl.um> <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_340-352.wav|<breath> and hackney downs so i live in hackney and stoke newington <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_352-366.wav|<breath> actually cliffhold park as well <disfl.um> and i think that's an important part <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_366-392.wav|<breath> of <breath> what we do and how we get away from the busy life of the city <disfl.um> i enjoy going to the parks and <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_392-411.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> just watching people play basketball or football lying down reading <disfl.um> taking a jog taking a nap <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_411-427.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> victoria park i quite like in the summer it's really full and bustling and <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_427-445.wav|<breath> really big so you can just meander about for a long time <disfl.um> hackney downs is more <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_445-458.wav|<breath> local <disfl.um> so it feels like it's really part of the community <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_458-471.wav|<breath> crystalled park is really lovely as well it's very family oriented so <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_471-487.wav|<breath> you can find deer and birds and <breath> goats i guess and horses or whatever <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_487-504.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> which is also nice because it it also gives kind of a community feel <disfl.um> <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_504-506.wav|<breath> <breath> <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_506-531.wav|<breath> i haven't really done touristy stuff in london for quite a long time when <disfl.um> my partner and i moved back to london in <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_53-80.wav|<breath> we stayed in frankfurt for a year but then decided that it was a bit dull for us so we decided to move back to london <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_531-544.wav|<breath> 2016 we had a bunch of friends coming almost every weekend so <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_544-556.wav|<breath> we would take them to a lot of the tourist attractions <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_556-564.wav|<breath> london eye south bank tate borough market <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_564-585.wav|<breath> a lot of stuff around this side of the city this side of the river as well st <disfl.um> paul's <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_585-606.wav|<breath> shortage brick lane <breath> we <disfl.um> almost had kind of a routine and we just walk around with our friends <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_606-623.wav|<breath> chat but also kind of lazily look around which is another nice thing about london is <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_623-645.wav|<breath> you can just ample about but your eye can still be interested in what you see architecturally <disfl.um> kind of the <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_645-661.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> people the graffiti all of that i think it's really it's <disfl.um> really nice <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_661-677.wav|<breath> to walk around some <disfl.um> <breath> of the stuff i would say is a bit <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_80-92.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> in 2016 and i've been in london since then <disfl.um> <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_04_92-102.wav|<breath> we quite like london it's an exciting city <disfl.um> <breath>|4
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_0-19.wav|i came to london to <disfl.um> <breath> study at ucl i came to london from new york i came <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_104-118.wav|<breath> beyond that <breath> the ability to live a life that i found interesting <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_118-134.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i like about london <disfl.um> the fact that there is a lot going on <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_134-150.wav|<breath> i like the amount of parks there are actually is one of my favorite things <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_150-179.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> living in new york there's really only two big parks well there are a few big parks but the two biggest parks that i would frequent were <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_179-203.wav|<breath> central park and prospect park <breath> outside of that you just have very tiny parks some <disfl.um> the size of a parking lot <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_19-27.wav|<breath> to london to study philosophy in particular <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_203-225.wav|<breath> so what i like about one is i live close to hampstead heath i live close to regent's park as well <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_225-256.wav|<breath> and i can frequent those massive parks very easily beyond that there's a lot of other parks too though even just in the north we have victoria park we have <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_256-279.wav|<breath> others as well <disfl.um> so i like <breath> being outside in london i like exploring i like taking pictures in the parks <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_27-50.wav|<breath> i'm studying for my mphil m at ucl <breath> <disfl.um> part of why i came to london also is the city itself <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_279-297.wav|<breath> going to concerts going to shows <breath> going to museums <disfl.um> what do i dislike about london <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_297-314.wav|<breath> i dislike the weather sometimes <disfl.um> it rains a lot in london as you might know <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_314-337.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so <breath> i dislike the idea that i wake up and it's raining and i go to bed and it's raining <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_337-358.wav|<breath> and sometimes it's very gloomy and that can be a little bit depressing to not see the sun very often <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_358-374.wav|<breath> which an issue the issue of not seeing the sun very often is exacerbated by <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_374-390.wav|<breath> there being very short days during the winter once it turns into daylight savings time <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_390-416.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> it's dark by 00 04 p m completely pitch black by 05 00 p m at the latest i'd say 04 30 p m <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_416-437.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and when it's raining outside all day and i don't wake up often i don't wake up till about <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_437-458.wav|<breath> 11 00 unless i have school and really my closest my earliest <disfl.uh> day is 11 00 p m so <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_458-474.wav|<breath> i'm only out of the house by ten so it's only 5 hours and then <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_474-511.wav|<breath> when you have class and you have work the days go by very quickly and you don't see a lot of the sun and i do miss that so that's one thing i dislike about london <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_50-58.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> it's a very interesting big city <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_511-521.wav|<breath> do you have <breath> a favorite restaurant <breath> mhm <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_521-531.wav|<breath> my favorite restaurant is not available in london <disfl.um> <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_531-553.wav|<breath> my favorite restaurant is actually my dad's restaurant he owns an <disfl.ah> italian restaurant in north carolina in the united states <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_553-568.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and it's not available in london obviously but my favorite type of cuisine <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_568-591.wav|<breath> is certainly available in london i have a few different i wouldn't say have one particular type of cuisine that's my favorite <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_58-92.wav|<breath> and coming from new york i wanted to live in another city that was interesting to me and had a lot of culture a lot of museums a lot of music going on <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_591-617.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> well i cook a lot actually so that's all available in london i cook a lot with tofu i cook a lot of vegetables <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_617-642.wav|<breath> i really cook meat very much <breath> that is available in london i just don't utilize it but i do like to go to <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_642-661.wav|<breath> restaurants don't i have a particularly favorite though i wouldn't say that there's any one that's my favorite <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_661-693.wav|<breath> have i been to any parks yes i've been to a lot of parks in london my favorite favorite park is my favorite two parks are regents and hampstead heath <disfl.um> <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_693-720.wav|<breath> i'd say that my favorite between those two is hampstead heath it has a little bit more of acquaintance to it regents <disfl.um> feels like it's <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_05_92-104.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> art scenes <breath> so i came for school first but <breath>|5
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_0-14.wav|what brings me to london well i'm from london so i was already here <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_106-137.wav|<breath> and <breath> it's very busy which i like <disfl.um> the only thing i don't like about it is that it's difficult to go anywhere with countryside <disfl.um> i'm very outdoorsy <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_137-156.wav|<breath> so i like to climb rock climbing but there's not really anything outdoors so that is a problem <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_14-26.wav|<breath> but i came to central london to start studying at ucl <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_156-173.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i think that in the future i probably won't stay here because i think that <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_173-184.wav|<breath> it's only good when you're <breath> kind of younger <disfl.um> <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_184-205.wav|<breath> favorite restaurant or cuisine <disfl.uh> <breath> or is it available in london well everything's available in london really cuisine wise <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_205-244.wav|<breath> i do quite like japanese food and <breath> there's quite a lot of that it seems quite fashionable at the moment i remember when i was younger it was kind of harder to find a japanese restaurant but <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_244-256.wav|<breath> there's a lot now so it's clearly very very popular <disfl.um> <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_256-266.wav|<breath> i like a good katsu curry <breath> nice ramen <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_26-50.wav|<breath> because i was bored of my job and thought i should do something more useful so i came to ucl to study anthropology <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_266-284.wav|<breath> pretty nice <breath> my favorite actually i do like a <breath> lot of different <disfl.uh> asian foods <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_284-325.wav|<breath> but <breath> <disfl.um> yeah very tasty <breath> have <disfl.uh> i been to any of the parks in london yeah i often go to hampshire heath or go for a run i live about 20 minutes walk from there in archway <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_325-355.wav|<breath> so i often go for a run around there or in the summer just chill there with friends do some slack lining which is where you balance on a <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_355-364.wav|<breath> kind of rubber elastic thingy it's good fun <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_364-378.wav|<breath> also <disfl.uh> regents park is very nice <breath> but a lot busier i <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_378-400.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> have a friend who lives near richmond park so sometimes i go down there see the deer very nice <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_400-419.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i think if <breath> i met someone near the city i would probably recommend that they <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_419-432.wav|<breath> go to east london <breath> have a little walk around hear the <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_432-453.wav|<breath> local accents and that everyone from other countries knows about cockney and all that so i guess it's quite interesting <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_453-476.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i have a favorite cafe in bethnal green which i would say is quite good to go to because it's very <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_476-505.wav|<breath> kind of classic east london <disfl.um> i'd also recommend they go to all the classic sites because it's probably more interesting to them than it is for me <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_50-60.wav|<breath> because i'm interested in people and culture and society <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_505-524.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i don't really know tourist tractions very well so i'd probably be a really bad guide <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_524-542.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> but yeah i'd probably show them the parks as well as i said like hampton heathen <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_542-565.wav|<breath> and <disfl.uh> regents park and that <breath> also the canals are really nice <disfl.um> that'd be really cool for people to see <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_565-587.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah i haven't really been to many of the tourist attractions i haven't been to london eye very expensive <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_587-619.wav|<breath> which is probably why haven't i been <breath> i went to the tower of london not long ago my mum because i thought i should really see some of these attractions <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_60-84.wav|<breath> and so <breath> also i like london so i wanted to stay so i decided to move further into london from the south <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_619-634.wav|<breath> and it was quite cool <breath> a lot of lot of museums in there <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_634-641.wav|<breath> but expensive so expensive i mean <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_641-655.wav|<breath> yeah you have to be a certain type of tourist to enjoy london <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_655-680.wav|<breath> but <disfl.um> other tourist attractions like a lot of museums obviously british museums really near ucl so i've been there quite a few times <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_680-715.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> there was one museum that was really good that i would recommend to people but i can't remember the name of it but it's kind of like almost like a surgery museum <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_715-745.wav|<breath> and there's a lot <breath> of weird body parts in like jars it's really weird and <disfl.uh> quite edgy so i think a lot of people would be interested <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_06_84-106.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and i like london because there's lots of stuff going on it's very buzzing with culture and arts and music <breath>|6
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_0-18.wav|<disfl.um> i don't live too far from london in general <disfl.um> i just live about 20 minutes away <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_104-126.wav|<breath> <breath> <breath> <disfl.um> i think it's a city with a lot of opportunities and i think i've appreciated that more when <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_126-147.wav|<breath> you meet people that are moving to london for the first time and <disfl.um> you kind of get to know <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_147-163.wav|<breath> their backgrounds and the lack of opportunities available in their cities so <disfl.um> yeah that's <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_163-179.wav|<breath> pretty much the things i think i like <breath> about in london in general <disfl.um> <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_179-203.wav|<breath> i don't like how london is very touristy <breath> <disfl.um> sometimes it can be really frustrating especially around the most touristy areas <disfl.um> <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_18-44.wav|<breath> and <disfl.um> the reason why i did come to london is because i studied at ucl <disfl.um> and i studied history and philosophy of science <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_203-220.wav|<breath> the london transport system for example is not designed to handle the influx of tourists so <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_220-237.wav|<breath> times can be quite busy and <disfl.um> yeah it's just a bit frustrating in that sense <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_237-268.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> it's also quite an expensive city i think in terms of rent which makes it quite hard for people to move in and find a job that pays enough <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_268-279.wav|<breath> to pay rent and so on and so forth <disfl.um> <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_279-296.wav|<breath> and <breath> perhaps <breath> there's too much happening in london there's too much things closing down <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_296-312.wav|<breath> so there's lots of bars and clubs closing down recently which has been quite frustrating <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_312-324.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and they've been opening up new properties as a result <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_324-333.wav|<breath> which has been a bit annoying <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_333-349.wav|<breath> yeah i think i like indian and turkish food <breath> probably because that's my background <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_349-381.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i quite like to go to nando's which is a bit of a cliche but i've always gone as a child so it has a special place in my heart <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_381-405.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i have been to almost all the parks in london <disfl.um> i think my favorite definitely has to be hampstead heath <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_405-433.wav|<breath> it's a little bit away <breath> from the touristy parts which is quite nice because it's usually local people that go to hamster heath are not tourists <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_433-461.wav|<breath> which is nice because there's lots of space and it doesn't feel too busy <disfl.um> so you can really enjoy yourself there and have a good time <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_44-70.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i've just graduated now and i'm looking for a graduate job in london <disfl.um> so i think that's basically what brings me to london <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_461-477.wav|<breath> relax have a picnic and just relax with friends in the summer it's really cool <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_477-494.wav|<breath> they also have some swimming pools as well where you can go like swimming <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_494-506.wav|<breath> and i think it's quite a nice park in general <breath> <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_506-537.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i think if there was someone new i would recommend that they would obviously have to do all the parks i think it's really cool i think perhaps <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_537-570.wav|<breath> yeah parks would be quite cool <disfl.um> <breath> not get fish and chips i'd recommend there's so many different restaurants in london so i would recommend trying as many cuisines as possible <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_570-589.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and not just sticking to british food because i think british food is quite rubbish in general <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_589-615.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i would recommend definitely going to the nightclubs we have some really famous nightclubs in london like fabric and miniature sound and egg <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_615-632.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and i recommend you at least do one of these before you leave london because <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_632-668.wav|<breath> these clubs have been around for quite some time <breath> we have some really cool bars <disfl.um> oxford street is quite cool i guess as a tourist <disfl.um> perhaps going to some shopping malls and <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_668-681.wav|<breath> checking the art galleries that would be quite cool i think <disfl.um> <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_681-695.wav|<breath> i think what i quite like doing is <breath> going to kind of <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_695-703.wav|<breath> places that not many people visit so <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_70-85.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i what like about london is that it's a very fast paced city <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_703-728.wav|<breath> i just like going to galleries that are not as well known <disfl.um> and perhaps just escaping central london so perhaps going to like <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_728-748.wav|<breath> zone four zone five zone six and some there's actually quite cool things to do there i think <disfl.um> <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_07_85-104.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> there's lots to do there's lots of interesting people there's some cool clubs and some cool bars <breath>|7
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_0-25.wav|<disfl.um> even though i <breath> sort of live in london i'm always more in the central part of london rather than the outskirts of it <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_113-137.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i like the different shops now the food shops that are starting to come up there's all different ones like <disfl.uh> <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_137-145.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> more street vendor ones more from <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_145-157.wav|<breath> say you got i don't know <breath> somewhere from thailand or <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_157-168.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> spain but it's more of the ones that you <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_168-200.wav|<breath> wouldn't get over here that are starting to come up in little pop up sort of shops and stalls that are often really nice different foods that are very sort of <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_200-218.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> unheard of or you've seen them they're sort of not being put in the same mixture <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_218-229.wav|<breath> in the way that you sort of think <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_229-272.wav|<breath> things that i don't really like <breath> about london although i do like it is the fast pace because although it is fast paced and it's good and everything's on the go go go sometimes you can get into this sort of <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_25-37.wav|<breath> i find it more <breath> <disfl.um> like vibrant it's more fastpaced <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_272-284.wav|<breath> bobberation like this or it's too much or it's too overcrowded <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_284-310.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> there's bumping in the road <breath> <disfl.um> london transport gets too much especially when you've finished work you got to get on the tube <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_310-335.wav|<breath> so <disfl.um> yeah london transport although it's good as well it serves its purpose but other times it can just be a bit of <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_335-349.wav|<breath> an annoyance until you get like a clear carriage or clear bus a <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_349-363.wav|<breath> and a clear lane for it to go down it's brilliant <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_363-375.wav|<breath> there's loads of restaurants as well around in london <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_37-51.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> there's a lot of things to do there's a lot of shops <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_375-394.wav|<breath> yeah there's different ones but i think i like <breath> <disfl.um> there's a place called like benny harner <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_394-432.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> where the chef sort of comes to your table and cooks the food up in front of you i think that's really good it's different but <disfl.um> i think it's been around for a while but <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_432-463.wav|<breath> only got introduced to it myself not too long ago <breath> i like the new little donut stools and shops that are opening up that are starting to take over <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_463-480.wav|<breath> and the nice health shops that are sort of <breath> coming up that are sort of <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_480-506.wav|<breath> basically being the infinite now <breath> everyone's trying to eat cleaner and live better so there's more shops that are appearing that are serving that <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_506-528.wav|<breath> so there's a place called cross towns <breath> <disfl.um> yeah they do these sort of donuts are quite huge in size <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_51-64.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> there's a lot of places to go and little sort of <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_528-539.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> very nice my favorite one is the cinnamon <breath> <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_539-566.wav|<breath> cinnamon <disfl.um> scroll so it's a doughnut but it's like a <breath> cinnamon sort of pastry sort of thing but it's like a combined one but <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_566-581.wav|<breath> yeah very nice <breath> and there's <disfl.um> <breath> loads of parks as well to <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_581-594.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> go about <breath> hyde parks are really good sometimes they have <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_594-625.wav|<breath> like once a year big winter wonderland over there <breath> and it's really really big and covers it sort of the whole of that field they have over there available <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_625-635.wav|<breath> loads <disfl.um> of things to do loads of rides <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_635-660.wav|<breath> loads of stalls offering different quirky things loads of people it's <disfl.um> just a very vibrant sort of fun place to be nighttime <disfl.um> <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_64-76.wav|<breath> offbeat sort of like back rows key little shops and stalls <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_660-679.wav|<breath> is better as well because it's got more <breath> of that sort of edge to it you see <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_679-694.wav|<breath> the lights you get more of the feel the entertainment feel from it but <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_694-706.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i think you should when you come to london <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_706-744.wav|<breath> visit <breath> say <breath> camden they've got a nice camden market it's all got these sort of little quirky little back areas and little alleys and back sort of street shops and markets and whatnot brick lane is|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_76-95.wav|<breath> that you're unaware of <disfl.um> it was feels like you've sort of seen the whole of london but <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_08_95-113.wav|<breath> this is why i'd like to sort of keep coming back and <breath> having a look about <breath>|8
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_0-16.wav|i came to london <disfl.um> to do my undergrad degree following <disfl.uh> finishing my a levels <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_105-114.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i worked full time at various cafes <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_114-125.wav|<breath> and then i started my masters in <disfl.uh> september <disfl.um> <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_125-133.wav|<breath> my favorite things about london are that <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_133-143.wav|<breath> it's always busy and there's always something to do <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_143-159.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i am from a little village in the countryside in the middle of nowhere <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_159-181.wav|<breath> so moving to london was a big deal and it was sort of the complete opposite of where i grew up <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_16-30.wav|<breath> i <breath> started <disfl.um> a degree in biomedical sciences it was a bsc <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_181-198.wav|<breath> and i like how busy it is and there are so many options to do things <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_198-211.wav|<breath> i don't have to plan things too far in advance i can <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_211-230.wav|<breath> spontaneously go out to the market or <breath> go see a park or a museum or gallery <disfl.um> <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_230-253.wav|<breath> i studied archeology so i really like museums and i'm into art as well so i like the art galleries in london <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_253-271.wav|<breath> the <disfl.ah> tate modern is my favorite <breath> or the victoria annalbert museum in south kensington <disfl.um> <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_271-288.wav|<breath> i like the victoria and albert museum because there's a huge range of things to see <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_288-294.wav|<breath> lots of different materials <disfl.um> <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_294-308.wav|<breath> some things that i don't like about london are that it's really busy <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_30-52.wav|<breath> at king's college london <breath> <disfl.um> i was at the guys campus for about a term and then i dropped out <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_308-337.wav|<breath> so i like it and i don't <disfl.um> <breath> it can be really stressful to just go and do things <disfl.um> simple things like going to the shops <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_337-357.wav|<breath> because of all the people <breath> <disfl.um> i also hate it when tourists walk really slow on the pavement <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_357-367.wav|<breath> that's one of the worst things about london <disfl.um> <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_367-382.wav|<breath> my favorite restaurant <breath> is <disfl.uh> hard to pick i have quite a few <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_382-399.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> one of my favorite restaurants to go to is flatiron <disfl.um> it's in common garden <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_399-426.wav|<breath> <breath> and it just does steak <breath> there's only one thing really on the menu <disfl.um> and then you choose your sides to go with it <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_426-443.wav|<breath> i've been quite a few times with my brother my boyfriend i took my family there <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_443-468.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> you get free popcorn at the start of the meal you also get free ice cream on your way out which i love <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_468-490.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but the only thing i don't like about the restaurant is that there are always massive <disfl.uh> waiting times <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_490-512.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i love the parks in london i live in camden so regents park is really close as is primrose hill <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_512-520.wav|<breath> i really like primrose hill <disfl.um> especially <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_52-67.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and then the following week i submitted an application for university college london <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_520-545.wav|<breath> for new year's eve <breath> i went the other week with my flatmates to watch the fireworks and do a countdown from the hill <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_545-570.wav|<breath> which was really fun <disfl.um> i also like hampstead heath i've been there quite a few times also been there swimming in the ponds <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_570-575.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> my favorite park <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_575-590.wav|<breath> would have to be <breath> regents park just because i've spent more time there <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_590-597.wav|<breath> than the others <breath> <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_597-613.wav|<breath> if i met someone new to the city i would recommend that they go to <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_613-633.wav|<breath> the museums just because they're free <breath> and you get <breath> to see so much for no money <disfl.um> <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_67-74.wav|<breath> for archaeology <disfl.uh> that was a <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_74-87.wav|<breath> bachelor of science <breath> <disfl.um> so i came to london in september <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_09_87-105.wav|<breath> studied <disfl.um> for three years during my undergrad degree <breath> then i <disfl.um> took a year out <breath>|9
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_0-17.wav|<disfl.uh> so i came to london because i decided to study abroad in my junior spring semester <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_103-159.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> i looked at a lot of schools around the area as well <breath> but my school back home is in a suburban rural area and i also kind of grown up in like a suburban neighborhood and i really wanted to experience what it was like living in a city and i thought that <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_159-206.wav|<breath> studying abroad during this time would be really great and i also enjoyed that ucl although it was in the center of london had its own campus which is something that i look very strongly in for schools which also decided my school back home as well|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_17-40.wav|<breath> i <disfl.uh> chose london out of all the cities in the world because i've actually never been to europe or the uk <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_207-228.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i've only been in london for about two weeks but i really like how accessible everything in london is <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_228-245.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> like things are like a few minutes walk here or a few minutes walk there <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_245-264.wav|<breath> and it's really great because it gets me to exercise as well which i would have never done <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_264-277.wav|<breath> back home at my school or anywhere in general to be honest <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_277-297.wav|<breath> i <disfl.um> also really like how there's a variety of cuisines at london and i can really find restaurants <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_297-347.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> from all over the place like here which are close in proximity or just like right next door to each other which i think is a great way to really try foods from other countries and also just kind of explore the culture of london and uk itself <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_347-380.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> another thing i like about london is how all the museums are free most museums are free <disfl.um> i haven't gone to all of them yet but i've gone to some <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_380-400.wav|<breath> and i think it's a really great way to learn about history and a really exciting way as well <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_40-69.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so i was really intrigued and interested in life was in london the culture in london and just i felt that there a lot of things to <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_400-421.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> some things i do not like about london i feel like this is not like specific to london <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_421-466.wav|<breath> but i don't like how early the sun sets <breath> it's kind of sad when i look out the classroom at like 30 04 p m and it's super dark outside and sometimes i have events that happen at like 06 00 p m <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_466-487.wav|<breath> and walking in the wind and rain but it's definitely better than walking in the wind and rain at rochester <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_487-500.wav|<breath> so i guess it's <breath> not that i don't like it it's <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_500-530.wav|<breath> just not something i look forward to <disfl.um> <breath> i think another thing that i don't like about london it might be just because i'm not used to it <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_530-543.wav|<breath> but <breath> the crossing at london some people just go at streets <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_543-572.wav|<breath> so <breath> i feel like i'm like too scared sometimes i'll put a foot down and then i see that there's no cars and i'll try to go <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_572-620.wav|<breath> but then i get scared and i go back to the sidewalk and i wait until super long until the light changes sometimes i feel bad because everyone else is gone and i'm just there so i think that's just something i have to get used to <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_620-631.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> do i have a favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_631-660.wav|<breath> yes i do it actually recently opened up the restaurant opened up near me at my hometown it's called hi de la it's a chinese hot pot place <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_660-678.wav|<breath> and it actually is available in london in piccadilly circus and i saw it the other day <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_678-717.wav|<breath> when i went with friends to just walk around so i'm very excited that there's something i'm familiar with and i can go back and try because it's a really good hot hot place i really recommend it <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_69-87.wav|<breath> like look at and also explore about in london so i chose london as my final destination <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_717-746.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> have i been to any of the parks in london <breath> i actually haven't gone to any parks in london yet or any of the big parks <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_746-769.wav|<breath> i mean i've walked around some parks but i never went in i think that's definitely something i have to do because <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_769-788.wav|<breath> where i come from parks really aren't a thing we have like one state park near my house <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_788-812.wav|<breath> rochester caused quite a bit of parks as well i just haven't gone which is probably something i should do there as well <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_11_87-103.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> ucl was one of my top choices for schools to study at because <breath>|11
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_0-18.wav|i moved to london in 2017 to start my masters at ucl at the institute of cognitive neuroscience <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_110-142.wav|<breath> very much not used to the city <breath> but i really like all the green space that london has i find that other cities i've been to like new york city <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_142-166.wav|<breath> and washington dc just don't have quite enough green for me and feel very overwhelming because of tall buildings and very corporate feel <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_166-187.wav|<breath> but i really like that london has lots of trees and parks and generally buildings that are not so high <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_18-30.wav|<breath> in cognitive neuroscience <breath> so i did that for a year <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_187-212.wav|<breath> and i also love all of the free museums that's probably one of my favorite things about living here you don't have to spend <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_212-230.wav|<breath> loads of money although it's easy to do that too while going out and about in london <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_230-267.wav|<breath> some things that i do not like about london are the air quality again <disfl.uh> being from a very rural part of the us i'm used to much different smelling and tasting air than in london <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_267-289.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i don't love that it doesn't get snow although i guess sometimes i do like that it's easier to commute <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_289-320.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> in london than in vermont because you don't have to scrape off your car full of ice and wade through sometimes like 5ft of snow to get to work <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_30-53.wav|<breath> and then i was applying for master's degrees for a second year as part of the same program that brought me here <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_320-358.wav|<breath> or <disfl.uh> even just to get to your car <breath> but i don't love the cold rain that you get especially this month in january when it's like big heavy wet cold rain i don't like that <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_358-379.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i don't like that it gets dark really early that's something i didn't expect when i moved here <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_379-404.wav|<breath> i thought being from really far north in the us would mean that i would be used to hours of daylight being relatively short <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_404-423.wav|<breath> but actually i think daylight hours in <breath> january at least are about 1 hour longer in vermont <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_423-435.wav|<breath> than in london so i struggle sometimes with the early sunsets <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_435-446.wav|<breath> and my other least favorite thing about london is probably <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_446-470.wav|<breath> the tube although <breath> i actually really appreciate having effective public transportation so i guess that's also something i like and don't like <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_470-482.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> my favorite restaurant in london is this place called <disfl.um> <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_482-501.wav|<breath> no i can't remember life goddess <disfl.um> it's a greek restaurant on store street and it's delicious in <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_501-537.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> general i love greek food and turkish food and my other favorite restaurant in london is a place called the pitted olive which is on lee street not far away from the icn <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_53-80.wav|<breath> but i decided instead to start my phd <breath> so i started my phd at the icn as well in 2018 and i'm doing that now <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_537-546.wav|<breath> my favorite park in london is richmond park <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_546-601.wav|<breath> i'm not actually sure that that's yeah no it is in london <breath> <disfl.um> i love that you can see all of the deer running around and it's really fun to cycle around the whole park <disfl.uh> although it's very challenging i learned when i went for the first time there's a massive hill right|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_602-626.wav|before you get to the fun part <breath> <disfl.um> but i really love richmond park i also love hyde park <disfl.um> and regents park <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_626-657.wav|<breath> and the canal at regents park too <breath> if i met someone new to the city i would tell them to definitely check out borough market which is a very <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_657-667.wav|<breath> <breath> traditional <disfl.uh> thing to say but it's probably <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_667-716.wav|<breath> the best thing i have ever experienced in my life <breath> we get the best olive oil and cheese from borough market and i always tell people to go there not necessarily to buy pre made food but to buy ingredients to make food because i think they have|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_12_80-110.wav|<breath> i really love living in london it's completely different than where i'm used to i grew up in a very rural part of vermont in the us so i'm <breath>|12
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_0-25.wav|so what brings you to london <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i came to london to go to university and study psychology and language sciences at ucl <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_109-116.wav|<breath> and it's very different from here <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_116-129.wav|<breath> some of the things i do not like about london is probably <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_129-140.wav|<breath> the pollution <breath> and how loud it is every night <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_140-161.wav|<breath> because <breath> i'm not used to that and i <breath> fall asleep very lightly and i wake up very easily <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_161-177.wav|<breath> and the accommodation is so hot that i have to open the window every night <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_177-189.wav|<breath> and every night without fail i hear ambulances and police sirens <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_189-196.wav|<breath> and it's just very sad <breath> <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_196-203.wav|<breath> favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_203-220.wav|<breath> i would say my favorite <breath> cuisine is probably asian because it's very homely to me <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_220-233.wav|<breath> and my family always used to cook food from hong kong the <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_233-251.wav|<breath> favorite dish made from obergin i don't know the english translation but it tastes very very good <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_25-51.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but after about a term i realized this course wasn't really for me so actually i'm dropping out and i'm going to change course <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_251-262.wav|<breath> even though it smells a bit funky favorite <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_262-282.wav|<breath> restaurant at the moment <breath> i don't really have a favorite restaurant but i did hear that roti king <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_282-300.wav|<breath> near houston station is very good <breath> so i'll probably go visit that soon for some roti <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_300-309.wav|<breath> as well as for the atmosphere m <breath> <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_309-329.wav|<breath> i like japanese food but <breath> a lot of the more budget end sushi is not that great here <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_329-345.wav|<breath> which is kind of sad <breath> but i do enjoy making sushi with my flatmates <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_345-362.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> that's quite entertaining even if we can't roll it out properly most of the time <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_362-376.wav|<breath> and it doesn't always taste great because most of them are vegan and <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_376-386.wav|<breath> we can't put a fish in it or anything <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_386-403.wav|<breath> have i been to any of the parks in london do i have a favorite park <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_403-422.wav|<breath> m <breath> i went to hyde park <breath> with my course mate last term which is very fun <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_422-442.wav|<breath> we walked there from our accommodation which was probably about <breath> a <disfl.ah> 35 minutes to 40 minutes walk <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_442-471.wav|<breath> which is not that bad but it's quite some exercise and then we had to walk further into hyde park to get to surf <disfl.uh> the serpentine i <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_471-502.wav|<breath> think that's the lake there <breath> it was a really chill day because it was autumn and all the leaves were starting to come down and it was quite pretty <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_502-510.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.oh> i heard that <disfl.uh> <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_51-64.wav|<breath> i'm hoping to study fine art at ucl again in september 2020 <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_510-531.wav|<breath> no wait yeah i went to winter wonderland which i know was in hyde park that was also very fun <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_531-554.wav|<breath> it was greater than i imagined and the food marketplace is very exciting and festive even though i do think that winters <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_554-575.wav|<breath> and christmas is quite overrated sometimes <breath> it was nice to go there with my friends and then my family <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_575-585.wav|<breath> for new years <breath> <breath> another m thing that <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_585-594.wav|<breath> i noted about the park in winter wonderland <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_594-614.wav|<breath> was that the rides were quite expensive which is very sad because i wanted to ride all of them <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_614-630.wav|<breath> but they were way too expensive and out of budget for me as a student <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_630-651.wav|<breath> <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if you met someone new to the city what would you recommend they go see or do <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_64-80.wav|<breath> some of the things i like about london are <breath> <disfl.uh> how multicultured it is <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_80-87.wav|<breath> and <breath> how big it is <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_13_87-109.wav|<breath> and how busy it is all the time <breath> because i came from a very small town in wales called monmouth <breath>|13
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_0-40.wav|<disfl.um> what brings me to london well i live in london so <disfl.um> i have lived in london for most of my life it's most probably the favourite my most favorite place in the world even though i have traveled <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_118-131.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> it can get quite busy there's a lot of people around <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_131-148.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> it's one of the major cities of the world so there's obviously lots of tourism <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_148-162.wav|<breath> that's attracted to london which is not necessarily a bad thing but <disfl.um> <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_162-175.wav|<breath> i think when you're <breath> a londoner and you're just trying to <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_175-190.wav|<breath> get around it can be quite difficult <breath> especially <disfl.uh> in the holiday seasons <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_190-198.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> do i have favorite a <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_198-207.wav|<breath> restaurant i have a favorite don't restaurant really <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_207-216.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but my <breath> favorite type of cuisine <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_216-227.wav|<breath> is probably turkish food or anything that's like grilled meat <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_227-241.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so yeah it's kind of like middle eastern but mediterranean style food <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_241-249.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> it's very widely available in london <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_249-262.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> particularly in certain areas of central london like eduar road or <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_262-268.wav|<breath> places like that or <breath> <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_268-286.wav|<breath> knightsbridge <disfl.um> turkish food is very tasty it's making me hungry right now even thinking about it <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_286-303.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> have i been to any parks in london do i have a favorite park <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_303-317.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i have been to pretty much most of the parks in london <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_317-336.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.ah> don't really have a favorite one but if i had to pick i would say <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_336-346.wav|<breath> regents park because it's in a really good location <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_346-355.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> having said that so is hyde park <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_355-366.wav|<breath> they're <disfl.uh> both in really good locations depending on what <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_366-388.wav|<breath> other things you want to do <breath> other than just going to a park <disfl.um> and within the parks obviously there's <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_388-399.wav|<breath> sort of activities that you can do like boat riding <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_399-412.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> et cetera and stuff like that so <disfl.uh> it's pretty cool <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_40-55.wav|<breath> been to other places but <breath> it's always london that <disfl.uh> calls you back <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_412-422.wav|<breath> it's quite fun <breath> especially on a summer's day <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_422-441.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if i met someone new to the city what would i recommend they go and see <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_441-460.wav|<breath> this is a good one <disfl.um> i think one of the things i really enjoy doing in london <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_460-477.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> even though i might have done it more than once <disfl.um> is visiting the museums <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_477-494.wav|<breath> in south kensington <breath> and i would really recommend if somebody was new to the city <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_494-511.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> to go and visit <disfl.uh> like the natural history museum and victoria and albert museum <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_511-528.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i just think there's so much to see <breath> and so much to learn and <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_528-567.wav|<breath> when you're kind of a londoner from birth pretty much and you have schooled in london you've visited these museums as a child but as an adult there's just so much more value to actually going there and <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_55-68.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> what are some of the things i like about london well <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_567-599.wav|<breath> taking it all in <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> the last question have you been to any tourist attractions for example the london eye did you enjoy it was overheated <disfl.um> i've been a|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_68-91.wav|<breath> i like that it's so <breath> varied there's so many different things to do in london so many different types of people <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_91-96.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.uh> yeah <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_14_96-118.wav|<breath> what are some of the things i don't like about london <breath> well it rains a lot it's <disfl.um> quite cold <breath>|14
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_0-17.wav|okay <disfl.um> so i'm down in london for work <disfl.um> and i work i do need to <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_122-135.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but my expenses get paid by the university which is great <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_135-159.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> some things i like about london <breath> are so i <disfl.um> really like the diversity of london <disfl.um> and i've got <disfl.um> <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_159-173.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> one impressively of my friends is really into <disfl.um> dressing <breath> really <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_17-38.wav|<breath> so i'm down in london for work <disfl.um> and normally i work in newcastle and that's where i live <disfl.um> <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_173-180.wav|<breath> <breath> i guess <disfl.um> properly <disfl.um> <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_180-196.wav|<breath> like a take on <breath> modern sort of dandy <disfl.um> with elaborate embroidery and stuff <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_196-204.wav|<breath> and <disfl.um> he always said that <disfl.um> <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_204-219.wav|<breath> basically whenever he was in london he just never felt like he stuck out <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_219-255.wav|<breath> m it was only other places that he felt like people were judging him for dressing weirdly so i really like that that basically you can do whatever you want and still fit in and <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_255-268.wav|<breath> there's also a lot of stuff going on in london generally it's <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_268-291.wav|<breath> really easy to find something to do in the evenings <disfl.um> <breath> but i guess the thing i don't like about london <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_291-304.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> when i was living here so i lived here for <disfl.um> <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_304-321.wav|<breath> i grew up here <breath> so i lived here until i was 18 then i spent <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_321-355.wav|<breath> three years in the northeast of england and i came back down here for my phd in my master so i spent another five years in london and now i've moved to newcastle <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_355-368.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and so i've spent a long time living in london <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_368-410.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and i guess the thing is that even though i said there's always something going on when i actually lived here i never actually went out and did any of that stuff <disfl.um> occasionally i go out for dinner somewhere <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_38-50.wav|<breath> but <disfl.ah> i've got kind of like a weird situation where <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_410-429.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but the kind of stuff that people do when they visit london they go to <disfl.um> <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_429-433.wav|<breath> <breath> the theater <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_433-453.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and stuff like that and i just never got around to it because i would always really exhausted <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_453-464.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i feel like the pace of life is generally <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_464-473.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> a lot <breath> more hectic in london <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_473-525.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and it's a lot more stressful because it's so expensive to live in london you have to live further out from where you work which means that you spend more time commuting and you just end up generally being tired at the end of the day is what i found <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_50-95.wav|<breath> my fellowship up in newcastle was meant to be hosted in london and i can only do the testing for the fellowship in london <disfl.um> but newcastle paid my salary so i live there and then they just give some money to ucl for me|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_525-542.wav|<breath> so you don't actually have the energy to go out and do all the cool stuff <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_542-550.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i guess my favorite cuisine <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_550-557.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i go through sort of <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_557-570.wav|<breath> different <breath> phases of liking stuff my fiance is a massive foodie <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_570-597.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and really i just go through phases like he goes through phases of <disfl.um> making different stuff and whatever he makes that's my new thing <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_597-616.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so he got really into tacos <disfl.um> and actually there are some quite good taco places in <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_616-632.wav|<breath> london <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but i mean there's good taco places all over i think <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_632-640.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and when i lived here <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/devel_15_96-122.wav|to do some work here <disfl.um> which is quite nice because i'm from london originally so i get to see my family and friends and stuff <breath>|15
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_0-24.wav|so i came to london first in 1992 after i had finished my phd at oxford and i was looking for a permanent job <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_116-127.wav|<breath> both really quite different and both located in different places <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_127-149.wav|<breath> i enjoyed working at london mets it was a trial by fire to some extent it was a post 92 university <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_149-159.wav|<breath> with some challenging widening participation and student achievement issues <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_159-188.wav|<breath> and limited resources <breath> but that made me quite creative and inventive <disfl.uh> in carrying out interventions to support and enhanced student experience without very much financial resources <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_188-200.wav|<breath> coming to ucl has been great because it is worldclass university <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_200-235.wav|<breath> the caliber of students is very different and more importantly there is financial support and resources and an organization that enables you to be creative on lots of projects to enhance our <disfl.uh> overall student|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_236-249.wav|experience <breath> so i've lived in london quite a number of years now <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_24-36.wav|<breath> i started first working at an institution called london guildhall university <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_249-274.wav|<breath> i never intended to live in london but i just went where the employment was however i have come to really really like london <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_274-308.wav|<breath> one of the great things i love about london are <disfl.ah> <breath> the people in terms of the ethnic diversity <disfl.uh> people live here from many different countries and have many different ethnicities <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_308-333.wav|<breath> and <breath> is very diverse culturally <breath> i love the parks in london i love the art galleries and the museums which are free <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_333-370.wav|<breath> and i love being in the capital and i miss it when i visit other places having traveled a lot to many other countries i <disfl.uh> still like being british and i like being in london <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_36-59.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> which later became london metropolitan university <breath> i started first as a very junior lecturer and left london metropolitan in 1992 <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_370-384.wav|<breath> some of the things that i don't like about london are the travel <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_384-411.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> the underground is really under resourced it's packed i live on the northern line it's called the misery lime for a very good reason and <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_411-437.wav|<breath> having visited other countries such as hong kong and shanghai and beijing where they also have metro systems i can see that they have taken <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_437-494.wav|<breath> they've come and looked at the london underground system and thought we're not going to do it like that so i know that it is possible to have better metro systems the other thing i don't like about london is the expense it's much more expensive to live here than it is in many other parts of|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_495-533.wav|the country or indeed any other part of the country <breath> <breath> i don't have a favorite restaurant <disfl.um> or cuisine because one of the great things about london is the diversity of food that you can eat here|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_534-553.wav|<breath> i particularly like chinese food <breath> i particularly like fish and shellfish and <disfl.um> there is a plethora <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_553-563.wav|<breath> of places to visit and <disfl.um> food to eat <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_563-588.wav|<breath> and i don't particularly have a favorite place <breath> <breath> i love the parks in london and my favorite park is probably clapping common <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_588-599.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> followed by st james's park followed by richmond park <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_59-86.wav|<breath> as a senior member of the faculty of life sciences i started working at ucl in september 2012 and i'm currently faculty teacher for brain sciences <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_00_86-116.wav|<breath> so what brought me to london initially <breath> and indeed has <disfl.um> maintained my stay in london has been my work which has been at two higher education institutions <breath>|16
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_0-22.wav|<disfl.um> so i've come to london <disfl.uh> for multiple reasons <breath> firstly i got married in september and my now husband works <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_114-123.wav|<breath> i've heard described as <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> just <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_123-150.wav|<breath> really not very <breath> like london <disfl.um> given it is in london it's very quiet and feels quite suburban and we have a village green and <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_150-167.wav|<breath> it's quite nice so <disfl.um> <breath> i actually like being able to escape the center and <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_167-190.wav|<breath> travel back out to the quiet suburbs <breath> that come in for work <disfl.um> and have the option to come in and <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_190-203.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> have all the attractions of london close by but <disfl.um> <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_203-222.wav|<breath> not too close <disfl.um> we did think about moving further in so that my commute would be better <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_22-35.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> in here london so i moved here to join him here <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_222-239.wav|<breath> but we decided we just liked it <disfl.um> further out where it was a bit quieter <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_239-258.wav|<breath> and like to me it isn't too bad <disfl.um> <breath> it's 35 minutes door to door which is <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_258-280.wav|<breath> pretty good for london so <disfl.um> i feel like we kind of have the best of both worlds in that way <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_280-296.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but there are there are lots of things i like about london too <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_296-318.wav|<breath> there are a lot of concerts here <disfl.um> <breath> which is nice we didn't have so many back in oxford so <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_318-332.wav|<breath> it's cool to get to see bands i like much <disfl.uh> more easily <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_332-357.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and the food as well <disfl.um> <breath> me and my husband quite like going to restaurants particularly he likes quite posh places so <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_35-47.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but also i got a job <disfl.um> here at ucl <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_357-381.wav|<breath> when his <disfl.uh> mum comes to visit we quite often go somewhere nice in london because she really likes her good food too <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_381-394.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so yeah we've been to quite a range of different places <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_394-415.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> around where we are there's a lot of italian restaurants not quite sure why i think there's quite a <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_415-433.wav|<breath> big italian community <disfl.um> <breath> which is probably my favorite type of food so that's quite nice <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_433-446.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so yeah we enjoy going out for food quite a lot <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_446-463.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and the parks in london are cool too <disfl.um> we have quite a few round <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_463-483.wav|<breath> where we are but i like the fact that even in the center <breath> you have these quite big <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_47-68.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> to postdoc work as a <disfl.um> which was lucky <breath> given my husband was here so that was good <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_483-506.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> open spaces that you can go to <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i really like hyde park for example that's really nice but <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_506-515.wav|<breath> most of them are pretty nice <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_515-524.wav|<breath> so i definitely recommend those to people coming <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_524-543.wav|<breath> to london for the first time i think the parks are one of the best things about london <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_543-552.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> there's all sorts something i would <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_552-563.wav|<breath> probably <breath> recommend if someone was new to the city <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_563-582.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> would be something called the wallace collection which is <breath> kind of like this old house where <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_582-598.wav|<breath> six centric old man used to live i think maybe he was an architect or <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_598-611.wav|<breath> something but he collected a lot of different things a lot of <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_611-621.wav|<breath> random bizarre things and they're all in this house <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_621-633.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and it's just a really interesting collection of objects and <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_633-665.wav|<breath> old bits of old buildings kind of all thrown in together and that was quite cool <disfl.um> i'm not sure many people know about that so that's probably what i would <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_665-675.wav|<breath> recommend to someone <disfl.uh> to go to if they <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_675-681.wav|<breath> were new to london <disfl.um> <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_68-81.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> london is quite different i was in oxford before which <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_681-692.wav|<breath> but i haven't really been to many of the other <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_692-702.wav|<breath> sort of big tourist attractions like the london i <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_702-715.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> don't know <breath> i think they're just often so busy <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_715-727.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and full of people that i tend to steer clear <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_81-98.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> is a m much smaller city and <breath> i find london quite <disfl.um> busy and <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_01_98-114.wav|<breath> quite overwhelming <disfl.um> but we live quite far out <disfl.um> for michael winchmore hill which <breath>|17
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_0-20.wav|<disfl.um> some things that i don't like about london <breath> is <disfl.ah> how busy and crowded it is always <disfl.um> <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_104-112.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i have a favorite restaurant <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_112-121.wav|<breath> in london <breath> and it's a malaysian restaurant <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_121-134.wav|<breath> i go there <breath> quite a lot <breath> with my partner and <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_134-145.wav|<breath> i always order the exact same thing every single time <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_145-154.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> it's a restaurant that is in chinatown <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_154-166.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and the food that i always order is a <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_166-179.wav|<breath> vegetable curry <breath> <disfl.um> it's quite spicy and i quite like spice <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_179-203.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and whenever we go it seems very busy but we always end up sharing a table with strangers which can be quite <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_20-40.wav|<breath> i <breath> don't like how packed it is on the trains in the mornings and londoners can be pretty <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_203-209.wav|<breath> an enjoyable experience <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_209-234.wav|<breath> whenever we go there i always <breath> can never finish my food so they give me a nice little takeaway box and i can <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_234-243.wav|<breath> then <breath> experience the same <breath> food again <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_243-252.wav|<breath> the next day which is great <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_252-271.wav|<breath> <breath> i have been to many parks in london i've been to the big one so hyde park <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_271-287.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> regents park <breath> <disfl.um> but my favorite park to go to is victoria park <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_287-296.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> which is in east london <breath> and <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_296-305.wav|<breath> that park is my favorite because <breath> there's <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_305-322.wav|<breath> always lots of dogs and <breath> <disfl.uh> whenever i go there i usually go to run <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_322-335.wav|<breath> and i can always stop and pet some dogs which is great <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_335-346.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> in the park they also have a <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_346-361.wav|<breath> big fountain <breath> and a lake and in the summer you can hire out <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_361-378.wav|<breath> the little <disfl.uh> boats <breath> <disfl.um> which was a disaster the last time i tried it <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_378-391.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> because i don't know how to row a boat <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_391-423.wav|<breath> and <breath> when i was at the park and i tried to row the boats <disfl.uh> the fountain in the middle meant that the boat kept being pulled towards the center <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_40-45.wav|<breath> rude <disfl.um> <breath> i <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_423-431.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> of the fountain which <breath> was <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_431-439.wav|<breath> very difficult to then steer the boat <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_439-450.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and all the people who were queuing up to <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_45-51.wav|<breath> don't like that <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_450-467.wav|<breath> also <disfl.uh> try out the boats <breath> were all pointing and laughing which was great fun <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_467-477.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.uh> this park is also special because <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_477-491.wav|<breath> i used to go there with one of my aunts when i was <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_491-514.wav|<breath> really small <breath> <disfl.um> and there was also a big <disfl.uh> playground there when i was a kid and we used to <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_51-55.wav|<breath> <breath> there's not <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_514-533.wav|<breath> always <disfl.um> go there every weekend <breath> <disfl.um> when it was warm enough and play on the <disfl.uh> <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_533-545.wav|<breath> equipment at the park there used to be this huge <disfl.um> <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_545-557.wav|<breath> pirate ship that you could climb on which was my favorite <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_55-66.wav|<breath> a lot of <breath> varied things to do in london <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_557-567.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> there were also lots of squirrel squirrels <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_567-583.wav|<breath> and we used to take nuts and feed the squirrels <breath> which was really fun <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_583-595.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> if i met someone <breath> who just came to london <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_66-84.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> of <breath> it seems like there are <breath> lots fun things to do and lots of <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_84-95.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> different things we can do in london but <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_02_95-104.wav|<breath> everything is so expensive so it's very difficult <breath>|18
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_0-25.wav|so i'm in london because i live in london and i work in london <breath> <disfl.um> i live in north london <disfl.uh> up in hornsey <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_100-112.wav|<breath> and i like that within that it has really nice little <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_112-140.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> towns and areas that have different character but also that they're constantly evolving and you always find something new and so i really feel like <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_140-157.wav|<breath> that phrase is true about when you've grown tired of london you've grown tired of life <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_157-169.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> some of the things i don't like about london <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_169-180.wav|<breath> i <disfl.uh> probably would notice that i don't <breath> like <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_180-199.wav|<breath> how much of a hurry everyone is in <disfl.um> and maybe <breath> without a bit of cold if <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_199-222.wav|<breath> i was spending more time in other places like i was recently in the united states and everyone was so overwhelmingly friendly <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_222-243.wav|<breath> and it really strikes you when you go back to london when everyone's just got their head done <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_243-262.wav|<breath> but i respect that so definitely not like it i don't like the fact that it's so expensive <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_25-51.wav|<breath> it's <disfl.uh> kind of between turnpike lane and mozilla hill and i work at ucl which is in bloom spray in the center of london <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_262-294.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> it gives me everything long and gives me everything but i hate that it's really expensive to buy property and things like that and that's been a bit limiting <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_294-330.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> do you have a favorite restaurant in cuisine <breath> <disfl.um> i'm going to tell you about where i'm going tomorrow so tomorrow i'm going to a polish restaurant which is near where i live <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_330-342.wav|<breath> and i'm going to have pierogi which are these dumplings <disfl.um> <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_342-395.wav|<breath> that you can get filled with meat or filled with cheese <breath> <disfl.um> and i'm going to taste some vodka and i'm going to have lots of delicious little salty bits and pieces to eat <disfl.um> so i really like polish food i really like turkish food of which there's loads in the|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_396-407.wav|area where i live so i really enjoy that <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_407-427.wav|<breath> haven't been to any of the parks in london i have been to loads of parks in london i <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_427-469.wav|<breath> do have parks that i really like one is cliffhall park which is in stoke newton i used to live near there i think it's just a really nice size there's lots of stuff going on people really use the park <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_469-493.wav|<breath> and it's attractive to look at <breath> and now i live right beside alexandra park which is beside alexandra palace and i really <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_493-521.wav|<breath> enjoy that it's really good for going and looking for <disfl.um> people out walking their dogs and looking at nice dogs so lots of people have different <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_51-77.wav|<breath> i've lived here for about <breath> 15 years <breath> <disfl.um> the things i really like about london i really like that london is huge and <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_521-542.wav|<breath> little yappy things and big bloodhounds and irish wolf hounds and all sorts and i just find it really entertaining <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_542-567.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if i met someone new what would i recommend they go and see or do i would recommend that people go to <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_567-586.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> some good craft beer breweries and there are lots around there are some around waltham stowe <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_586-617.wav|<breath> which are quite good there's quite a bit of variety there <breath> and i think people should go and have turkish food on green lanes in north london and just <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_617-639.wav|<breath> stroll around and kind of soak it up i think you can't get better hospitality than in some of those restaurants <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_639-660.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i have been deterred attractions obviously because i've lived here for so long i don't do it that often <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_660-672.wav|<breath> i've been on the london eye <breath> <disfl.um> which i really <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_672-685.wav|<breath> enjoyed <disfl.um> other things that i've done i've sometimes gone on the <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_685-704.wav|<breath> kind of commuter boat up and down the thames that's quite a good thing to do with visitors <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_704-715.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and in terms of museums i quite like the <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_715-737.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> dinosaur bit of the natural history museum i absolutely adore the grant museum which is part of ucl has <disfl.um> <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_737-765.wav|<breath> just lots of specimens of all sorts of different types of animal and it's kind of in this old victorian style there's lots of things in jars <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_765-791.wav|<breath> you can sponsor specimens there and have your name kind of on top of the jar for a year i'm <disfl.um> which is quite cute <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_77-100.wav|<breath> i like that it's busy and i like that it's full of all the different types of people you ever might encounter <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_791-813.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and <breath> other touristy things that i like to do i think walking in the south bank is really <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_03_813-824.wav|<breath> pleasant and fun and i quite like the architecture there <breath>|19
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_0-38.wav|so i'm a very big fan of restaurants especially in london i think one of my favorite things is going to new restaurants and i read a lot of restaurant reviews to find out restaurants to go to <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_109-133.wav|<breath> i quite like caravan which is a very nice chain of restaurants around london there's one in bankside there's one in king's cross <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_133-144.wav|<breath> and <disfl.uh> they do really good sharing plate type food <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_144-184.wav|<breath> of restaurants i haven't been to yet that i really like to go to <breath> <disfl.ah> black axe mangle is a very exciting looking kabab turkish restaurant but done by a proper chef who used to be at noma <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_184-200.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> it's quite odd that it's quite <breath> <disfl.uh> posh food but then it's done <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_200-211.wav|<breath> in a restaurant that constantly plates heavy metal <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_211-228.wav|<breath> so i'd quite like to go there but they only have tables for about 20 people <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_228-242.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so that's my list of places i would like to go to <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_242-262.wav|<breath> in terms of my favorite cuisine <disfl.uh> again i'm not quite sure i just quite like things that are <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_262-283.wav|<breath> new <breath> i spend a lot of time on instagram scrolling through looking at food finding new food to eat <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_283-293.wav|<breath> i saw a recipe recently <disfl.uh> in the guardian <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_293-300.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> from osalangi <breath> for a <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_300-309.wav|<breath> choco <breath> <breath> flan where you put in <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_309-326.wav|<breath> the cake mixture first and then the custard for the flan and then in the oven <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_326-366.wav|<breath> they swap places so you end up with the flan on the top and the cake on the bottom which i think is really interesting and i just kind of want to make it just want to see that <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_366-371.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so yeah <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_371-397.wav|<breath> what brings me to london well i grew up here i grew up in north london and muzzler hill and i went to school there <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_38-60.wav|<breath> i'm quite proud of the fact that i often tend to be the person to pick restaurants i go to friends <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_397-416.wav|<breath> i then left for a couple of years to go to uni and then very quickly decided that <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_416-442.wav|<breath> i probably wanted to do the rest of my studies and working in london <breath> so now i'm doing my phd ucl at in neuroscience <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_442-460.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> and i've stayed in london ever since but at the start of next year in 2020 <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_460-484.wav|<breath> i'm <disfl.uh> going to be moving to edinburgh for a couple of months to work with my industry partner for my phd where <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_484-496.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> we will be developing the app for my project so <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_496-512.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> that'll be really exciting and i think edinburgh looks like a really amazing city <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_512-527.wav|<breath> i tend to prefer to live in cities rather than smaller places i think <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_527-541.wav|<breath> just having grown up with having everything within arm's length and always open <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_541-563.wav|<breath> i think it'd be quite odd going somewhere where <breath> you kind of have to do everything between nine and five <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_563-583.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i think be a bit depressing also i don't drive which is definitely a very north london thing <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_583-609.wav|<breath> so i would find it quite hard to leave a city but i'm very excited about moving to edinburgh for a short period of time <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_60-79.wav|<breath> i <disfl.uh> think i have quite good taste in restaurants <breath> so in terms of a favorite restaurant <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_609-627.wav|<breath> what are some of the things i like about london well i've already listed a few i <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_627-655.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> think there's just so much to do in london and it's just so <breath> cultural and there's great food as i have mentioned at some length <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_655-676.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so yes i definitely find it hard to leave london what do i not like about london i <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_676-702.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> think some of the things that other people don't like about london in saying that london are quite cold they can be quite harsh <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_702-723.wav|<breath> and unfriendly place i quite like that i quite like the anonymity that you have living in a big city <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_723-735.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i'm not sure what i don't like about london <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_735-754.wav|<breath> maybe i'll find out after i moved to edinburgh and realize that it's a lot better <disfl.uh> i <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_754-774.wav|<breath> have been to any of the parks in london i have been to some of the parks in london <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_774-787.wav|<breath> i <disfl.uh> quite like st james's park i think it's quite nice <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_787-807.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i like the <breath> terrapins and the pelicans that they have there which i think is quite fun <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_79-109.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i would say that <breath> i would prefer going to a new restaurant to restaurant one that i've already been to but some very old reliable ones <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_807-833.wav|<breath> i grew up next to alexandra park or alipalley <breath> <disfl.um> which that's just a really nice park a lot of my memories are <disfl.ah> <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_04_833-847.wav|<breath> either going for walks in alipali with my dog or with friends or <breath>|20
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_0-26.wav|i first came to london to start my msc and then to do my phd because i really wanted to work with someone here at ucl <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_102-115.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but once i started cycling in london that was really great <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_115-140.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> because it's a lot faster to get to different places <breath> <disfl.um> and there are some really good cycle routes to and from <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_140-167.wav|<breath> work for me <breath> <disfl.um> i find it a bit more scary to cycle on routes that i don't know because there's a lot of traffic <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_167-176.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but it's generally really good <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_176-198.wav|<breath> and good to get some exercise <breath> <disfl.uh> i also quite like traveling on the bus rather than on the tube <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_198-210.wav|<breath> <disfl.ah> because it's much nicer to be above ground than underground <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_210-220.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and it's also really noisy on the tube <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_220-224.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_224-233.wav|<breath> don't really have a favorite restaurant in london <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_233-243.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but <breath> there are some really nice ones <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_243-258.wav|<breath> <breath> particularly ethiopian <disfl.um> food which i'm going to tonight i'm looking forward to <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_258-270.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah there are lots of different styles of food <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_26-43.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so i moved to london but it's not actually somewhere i ever wanted to move <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_270-288.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> we also like to go to a fish and chip place quite near us that has <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_288-297.wav|<breath> really good quality fish and also great haloumi <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_297-304.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> which is really good <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_304-319.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah <breath> i really like the area of london that i'm in <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_319-336.wav|<breath> i think my favorite bit is hampstead heath and <disfl.um> going to places like kenwood house <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_336-355.wav|<breath> because you can sort of escape london a little bit <breath> and get to somewhere a bit quieter <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_355-380.wav|<breath> and there are really great views of london from there that <breath> <disfl.um> if you climb up the hill <disfl.um> especially in the evening <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_380-400.wav|<breath> it's really nice to climb up the hill and just look over the city when the lights go on <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_400-416.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> really good views and actually from the top of hampstead heath as well there's <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_416-433.wav|<breath> great <disfl.um> panoramas of all of the city but you feel nicely removed from the city <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_43-62.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> at first i found it really big <disfl.um> because i grew up in quite small cities <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_433-452.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> which is really good and <breath> also at kenwood house they have really good tea and scones <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_452-464.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and yeah it's just a really nice place to walk <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_464-483.wav|<breath> and see <disfl.um> lots of people with their dogs <disfl.um> and they have good lakes there as well <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_483-499.wav|<breath> and places that you can swim in well some people swim there all year round <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_499-530.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> which seems a bit mad <breath> and freezing cold i swam there once in the summer on a boiling hot day in the middle of a very hot summer <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_530-543.wav|<breath> and it was so cold my hands sort of cramped <disfl.um> up <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_543-559.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so i don't know quite how they manage it in the middle of winter <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_559-573.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> but there are people who swim in sort of the open ponds <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_573-591.wav|<breath> all year round <disfl.um> but it does get really busy in the summer particularly when it's hot <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_591-602.wav|<breath> and that's a really fun thing to do in london <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_602-617.wav|<breath> so that's definitely the place i take visitors when they come and see me <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_617-635.wav|<breath> in london is actually not to the <breath> sort of classic sites like the london eye or <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_62-82.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and things take things a really long time to get to places but actually as i've lived here <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_635-660.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> anything really in the center <breath> <disfl.uh> maybe because lots of my friends aren't massively keen on big cities or loads of people <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_82-91.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i've enjoyed it a lot more <disfl.um> <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_05_91-102.wav|<breath> yeah i've found public transport here is really good generally <breath>|21
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_0-26.wav|i took a walk in st james's park <breath> i think that's a poem somehow which is rather rude which i'm not going to recite here <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_110-132.wav|<breath> it's <disfl.uh> equally very nice it might seem rather boring because there's no flowers there it's all green hence its name <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_132-159.wav|<breath> and apparently the story goes that the mistress of some king or other and i'm going to say george the fourth but i could be wrong <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_159-201.wav|<breath> lived across the park from <breath> st jake friday <disfl.uh> from green park think she lived somewhere near the mall not the mall what's that street called there's a street piccadilly street piccadilly something anyway near green park the station she lived|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_202-233.wav|there <breath> before the station was built <breath> and the old king used to cross over the park on his way to go and have his merry way with his mistress <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_233-280.wav|<breath> so the queen who was quite jealous of this <breath> she insisted that the park he walks through must not contain any blooms or flowers so she set a decree to make sure that he would always be remembered that the park he walks through on his|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_26-38.wav|<breath> but it's a <disfl.ah> restoration poem by the rochford i think <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_281-291.wav|way to his mistress <breath> would be devoid of color <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_291-304.wav|<breath> however i think it's quite a nice park so there we go <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_304-329.wav|<breath> now walking further along i think you get to hyde park which is ginormous even though ginormous is not an appropriate word i think <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_329-354.wav|<breath> but hyde park is interesting if you want to go for a long walk or a cycle i'm not a big fan of it <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_354-386.wav|<breath> it's very often the park where people go to see things at speaker's corner which used to be rather interesting back in the day when it was sort of very innocent <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_38-72.wav|<breath> and he went something in st james's park that's the first thing jim st james's park is a very nice park i quite like going for a walk there it's got all the <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_386-410.wav|<breath> and just some weird preacher but now people walk by thinking i wonder if this is going to be the next major terrorist <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_410-414.wav|<breath> just two minutes <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_414-427.wav|<breath> five minutes <disfl.oh> goodness gracious if i messed it up by stopping <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_427-479.wav|<breath> so if i continue along the park into hyde park and i walk past there would be terrorists or crack or weird old people in fact you don't see them these days not as much as once upon a time you might have done and when you do there's often a big|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_480-496.wav|police pleasant presence so it's not a very pleasant place to spend a lot of time <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_496-513.wav|<breath> however if you're on roller blades it's grand to go scooting around the park that way <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_513-530.wav|<breath> now i would say if my favorite park <breath> was in london it would probably be <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_530-561.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> the park next to my house it's not really a park it's more of a little graveyard <disfl.um> which might seem a bit more bid but it's very pretty <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_561-575.wav|<breath> and it has nice flowers in it and people often walk their dogs <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_575-611.wav|<breath> and i quite like a park with a lot of dogs <breath> i like dogs in fact i'm quite dog broodie i would have a dog myself if i could keep one in the flat <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_611-633.wav|<breath> if i walk further on to the next park nearby it's a bit crap so i don't go there very often <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_633-647.wav|<breath> victoria park <breath> which i used to think was the biggest but isn't <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_647-668.wav|<breath> is another fine park <breath> it's one along the canal side so if you want to go a cycle and <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_668-689.wav|<breath> go along the grand union canal and to victoria park and have an ice cream it's a grand day out <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_689-712.wav|<breath> in there i believe there's a little oriental garden in the middle of the pond which again is a nice little visit <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_712-727.wav|<breath> going south of the river we could get to <breath> <disfl.um> crystal palace area <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_72-95.wav|<breath> sights of london that you might want to see the buckingham palace and the back of downing street and horse guards parade <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_727-763.wav|<breath> and the crystal palace park is pretty grand that's quite impressive where it used to have <disfl.um> the old crystal palace where it gets its name which was the former site of the grand exhibition <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_06_95-110.wav|<breath> but if you walk off st james's park and you get to green park <breath>|22
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_0-20.wav|i came to london for a master's degree at the royal academy of music and i was there two years <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_107-121.wav|<breath> new york or london <breath> move somewhere that was <disfl.um> a cultural mecca <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_121-130.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> things that i don't like about london <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_130-153.wav|<breath> wow these actually i think i was asked all of these questions on a date i was on a few days ago <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_153-170.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> it's hilarious <breath> i mean things i don't like about london there aren't really any <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_170-190.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> there are things that i <breath> miss from home <breath> like i miss the mountains in the ocean <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_190-207.wav|<breath> but <breath> that's not why we live in london and that's why i left is because <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_20-34.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and i'm still there <disfl.um> as a fellow in a string quartet <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_207-229.wav|<breath> vancouver people live there for the mountains in the ocean and they want to go skiing and hiking and canoeing and <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_229-240.wav|<breath> they don't care about going to museums or going to <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_240-249.wav|<breath> watch music <breath> my favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_249-264.wav|<breath> i mean there's so much indian food here that's a big perk pretty cool <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_264-275.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i missed the asian food from vancouver actually <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_275-287.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> over half of the metro population of vancouver is asian <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_287-325.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and the chinese japanese taiwanese korean food is just incredible and i've found it hard to find affordable asian food in london but that's probably more the failure on my part than failure of the cities <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_325-356.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i've been to a lot of the parks i mean currently my favorite park is waterloo park just because it's such a close walk from my house so it's <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_34-42.wav|<breath> which sounds fancy but means very little <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_356-395.wav|<breath> easy to kind of walk over every few days and explore <breath> although i do love the heath i have a roommate that swims in the ponds every single day even though they're about four degrees right now <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_395-415.wav|<breath> which seems a little bit crazy to me but also i kind of want to do it but unfortunately <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_415-438.wav|<breath> the ponds are gendered so <breath> in the winter i feel like i need to go with someone to egg me on <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_42-61.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i like to go to galleries and museums that's probably my favorite thing to do in london <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_438-490.wav|<breath> and i don't have anyone to egg me on alexis if you ever want to go swim in the ponds in four degree weather please <disfl.um> that would be a lot of fun <disfl.um> and potentially terrifying and awful and we might both get sick and some kind of disease like <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_490-510.wav|<breath> are they clean i don't know they're kind of a concerning color in the summer so not totally sure <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_510-528.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if you met someone new into the what would you recommend they go <disfl.um> i <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_528-566.wav|<breath> walk along the canals i love the canals i think that was one they of were my favorite things when i moved but i think maybe because they eased me into kind of they're like semi nature <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_566-598.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but they're so beautiful and they kind of remind me of the high line which is like one of my favorite things in the world walking along the high line <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_598-635.wav|<breath> with a whitney right next to you walking into hell's kitchen and the canals kind of feel like that because the canals feel old and it feels like a natural center but at the same time <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_61-80.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i've <breath> seen some of the exhibitions at tate five times in the past couple of months <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_635-654.wav|<breath> you have this incredible new infrastructure and these modern buildings and the juxtaposition i just feel is stunning <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_654-690.wav|<breath> it's a beautiful way to see the city and feel a sense of calmness despite the cyclists zooming past and ringing their bells and people yelling there's still some of the chaos of london but <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_690-699.wav|<breath> also just a stillness and a beauty <disfl.um> <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_699-737.wav|<breath> the london eye <disfl.oh> man again i totally i talked about the london eye on this date i went on and i didn't like i just don't understand the whole the big deal with the london eye <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_737-775.wav|<breath> i've never been <breath> <disfl.um> maybe one day i'll go for a drink on the london eye and see what the view is like been to sky garden that's cool i tried to book sky garden for <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_775-794.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> my parents and i but it's totally booked up for the next few weeks which is sad <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_07_80-107.wav|<breath> that's one of my favorite things that's available in the city and definitely one of the reasons i moved here i always wanted to move to <breath>|23
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_0-16.wav|i came to london for work largely by necessity because of a lack of interesting opportunities <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_112-134.wav|<breath> in a way that i don't think is possible for me <breath> back in ireland at this stage of my life <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_134-150.wav|<breath> the things that i don't like in london have probably evolved in my time here <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_150-169.wav|<breath> and <breath> part of it is that i think london has become far more overcrowded in the last <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_16-29.wav|<breath> in ireland which is where i was born and raised <breath> i <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_169-197.wav|<breath> 15 20 to years that i remember it being <breath> i think that also has an effect on people's behavior i think people are a lot less <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_197-214.wav|<breath> well mannered <breath> in public people walking on the street seem to be quite happy to <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_214-230.wav|<breath> bump into people there's an expectation that <breath> everybody should get out of their way <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_230-243.wav|<breath> so for example i was in primrose hill a few years ago <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_243-280.wav|<breath> a woman decided that she should run backwards down the hill <breath> and was quite offended that i called her on this she seemed to think that everybody else should actually get out of her way <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_280-290.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> london has become a very dirty city <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_29-56.wav|<breath> have <breath> like certain things about london certain things i don't like i like the variety i like the interesting people that i get to meet <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_290-299.wav|<breath> people just seem entitled to just chuck their <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_299-316.wav|<breath> litter anywhere that they go <breath> people leaving their coffee cups sitting on top of a <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_316-326.wav|<breath> piece of equipment in the middle of the street <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_326-355.wav|<breath> equally i find that all these free bikes <disfl.um> for rent bikes are just parked in the middle of the pavement so for me walking along the street <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_355-373.wav|<breath> i'm supposed to get out of their way why because an american corporation wants to make money <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_373-388.wav|<breath> and because a lot of people think that <breath> the world revolves around them <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_388-402.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> do i have a favorite restaurant in london favorite food <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_402-416.wav|<breath> i've been fortunate over my career to have <breath> had years living on <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_416-431.wav|<breath> a business expense account where i could go and eat in very good restaurants <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_431-450.wav|<breath> as a result of that my preference these days is for informal places where i can chill out <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_450-462.wav|<breath> where i can relax <breath> and where i don't have to <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_462-486.wav|<breath> conform in certain ways <breath> so for me currently living around made a veil there are places like the elgin which have got <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_486-495.wav|<breath> good healthy food but it's not foodie food <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_495-516.wav|<breath> it is reasonably priced <breath> <disfl.um> the staff are friendly and a key part of the experience is the atmosphere <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_516-541.wav|<breath> <breath> the other thing i guess i like that is still hillary here in london is sushi for me i'm a yo sushi fan <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_541-556.wav|<breath> the idea that i can actually walk in and get this stuff reasonably priced <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_556-570.wav|<breath> is very appealing <breath> parks in london do i have a favorite i <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_56-72.wav|<breath> i think that there is lots of art here there are lots of lots <disfl.um> <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_570-594.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> live quite close to regents park for many years <breath> and i have played tennis there for about the last 15 years <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_594-614.wav|<breath> so i have a connection with that <breath> i'm currently walking looking after a friend's dog for the vacation <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_614-634.wav|<breath> as a result of which i've been taking this dog both for regents park and to paddington recreation ground <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_634-650.wav|<breath> yeah there's lots of good things in them <disfl.um> lots of space to walk around <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_650-654.wav|<breath> quite enjoyable <breath> <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_654-668.wav|<breath> recommendations on <breath> the city for somebody coming here for the first time <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_668-685.wav|<breath> i think the first question is what does that person like what is interest to them <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_685-696.wav|<breath> the old parts of london are attractive to some people <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_72-84.wav|<breath> cultural activities that at various stages during my time in london <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_09_84-112.wav|<breath> i have participated in i have liked <breath> <disfl.um> i guess there are also lots of people like me here so i feel reasonably comfortable with that <breath>|25
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_0-18.wav|what brings me to london is that i live here and i've lived here for about 25 years <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_122-137.wav|<breath> sometimes you just can't escape the fact that there are so many people around <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_137-153.wav|<breath> there's a lot of traffic in london and a lot of people using public transport <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_153-164.wav|<breath> you feel like you're fighting for space all the time <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_164-171.wav|<breath> i do have a favorite restaurant <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_171-189.wav|<breath> and it serves english cuisine but the inside of the restaurant is decorated in old church furniture <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_18-36.wav|<breath> i work here and i've lived in north london in the same place for about ten years <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_189-213.wav|<breath> it's based in kilburn in north london <breath> and you may be sitting on an old pew from a church while you're eating <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_213-235.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> being served wine from a chalice or you may be sitting staring at a pulpit with no minister in it <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_235-252.wav|<breath> the food is very good and it's not very expensive it's always quite a busy place <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_252-271.wav|<breath> i have been to all the parks in london but i think my favorite park is hyde park <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_271-298.wav|<breath> i like the fact that it has a lake <breath> and you can actually take a boat onto the lake and roll around in the summertime <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_298-309.wav|<breath> it also has a really nice cafe called the serpentine <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_309-330.wav|<breath> which is on the edge of the lake and you can sit outside all times of year have a coffee <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_330-340.wav|<breath> and watch the swans on the ducks gliding past <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_340-364.wav|<breath> it's always <disfl.uh> popular with tourists <breath> and hyde park is one of the royal parks in london of which there are five <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_36-52.wav|<breath> things i like about london are the multiculturalism the vast expanse of buildings and parks <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_364-391.wav|<breath> but i particularly like it because it's right bang in the center but you also feel like you're not in london when you're walking around it <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_391-401.wav|<breath> it has got a <breath> very interesting italian garden <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_401-411.wav|<breath> on the north side near <breath> gloucester <disfl.uh> place <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_411-428.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> which was designed in the early 19th century it has a pagoda and some fountains <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_428-457.wav|<breath> which make it a really nice place to chill out <breath> some of the other places in hyde park which are quite interesting are the peter pan statue <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_457-472.wav|<breath> and also speaker's corner where <breath> an ancient law allows people to stand up <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_472-500.wav|<breath> and say things even which are offensive nowadays but without getting arrested so it has the only place in london left where you have freedom of speech <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_500-513.wav|<breath> and you can discuss any subject <breath> you want without being arrested <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_513-530.wav|<breath> if i met someone new in the city what would i recommend they go and see <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_52-73.wav|<breath> and also the fact that it has a great historical and architectural rich environment in which you can walk around <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_530-542.wav|<breath> i think probably my favorite landmark in london is tower bridge <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_542-553.wav|<breath> i'm always in awe of the size of its structure <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_553-566.wav|<breath> and the fact that it is a bridge that actually opens up <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_566-580.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> to allow boats and ships to go through the center of it <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_580-598.wav|<breath> i've often marveled at the engineering and the fact that it was 250 built over years ago <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_598-624.wav|<breath> shows <disfl.uh> that the people that were around then are obviously very intelligent and they built something that really has lasted the test of time <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_624-640.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> the area around tower bridge is also very interesting because it used to be <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_640-655.wav|<breath> the old docks of london where all the ships the spices came in from <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_73-83.wav|<breath> free of charge and see the many great buildings <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_10_83-122.wav|<breath> that are here <breath> some things i don't like about london <disfl.uh> are the fact that it's so overcrowded seems that everywhere you go there are people every time of the day 24 hours seven days a week <breath>|26
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_0-25.wav|okay well <breath> i'd like to talk about actually <disfl.uh> my recent christmas holiday because it's quite an interesting and special and different <disfl.um> one <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_109-127.wav|<breath> and <disfl.um> it was kind of around the summer that i was just <disfl.uh> looking at <disfl.um> <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_127-148.wav|<breath> christmas plans <disfl.uh> and yeah vienna came up and actually there was a very interesting art exhibition that came up <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_148-173.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> they are displaying <disfl.uh> albrecht jurors <disfl.uh> the hair which is a very famous watercolor painting that is normally not on public display <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_173-193.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> they were displaying it for four months including over christmas <breath> so that kind of sealed the deal <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_193-209.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> we just went ahead and booked the flights in the middle of the summer <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_209-231.wav|<breath> quickly <disfl.um> found accommodation <disfl.uh> we'd been to vienna once before and we knew where to stay <disfl.um> excellent hostel there <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_231-240.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> and yeah we booked <disfl.uh> that room <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_240-257.wav|<breath> and <disfl.um> <breath> it was for the 23rd to the 26th so literally right over christmas <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_25-52.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> my partner and i decided this year that we were just going to take a few short days <disfl.uh> just exactly around the christmas dates <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_257-273.wav|<breath> it turns out that <disfl.uh> vienna is a fantastic city to visit over christmas <disfl.um> <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_273-289.wav|<breath> one of the reasons being that almost everything is actually open even on christmas day <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_289-303.wav|<breath> which i find it's really quite unusual in most <breath> cities even <disfl.um> <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_303-321.wav|<breath> the big ones like you really can't find much to do at all on christmas day but <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_321-330.wav|<breath> no the viennese like to keep things open <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_330-358.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and so yeah we flew there on monday <disfl.uh> the 23rd immediately after checking and we went out to the christmas markets and honestly they were <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_358-373.wav|<breath> some of the most extraordinary christmas <disfl.um> markets i had ever seen especially <disfl.uh> <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_373-385.wav|<breath> the big one which is right <disfl.uh> in the <disfl.um> square <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_385-398.wav|<breath> where the town hall is <disfl.uh> it's pretty massive it's pretty colorful <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_398-418.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> it's pretty large they even have an ice rink that has apparently 3 km worth of skating <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_418-435.wav|<breath> not that we did the skating but <disfl.um> it was really quite interesting to see and <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_435-455.wav|<breath> yeah just some really great food like <disfl.uh> some really great grilled sausages we had and <disfl.uh> some paragi <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_455-464.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> and it was really quite a spectacular <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_464-475.wav|<breath> place to be <disfl.um> <breath> however the city actually has <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_475-496.wav|<breath> markets throughout the city <breath> and we covered a few of the other ones a few of the smaller ones <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_496-506.wav|<breath> i think my favorite one was the one <disfl.uh> <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_506-520.wav|<breath> just <disfl.uh> outside of the big <disfl.um> cathedral there the st stephen's dome <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_52-74.wav|<breath> to <disfl.um> go to vienna <breath> <disfl.uh> we had been on on a christmas holiday last year <disfl.uh> in germany for <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_520-548.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> we got some really great actually that one had the best mulled wine the whole city it was one of the best mulled wines that ever <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_548-570.wav|<breath> tasted in my life <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and we got <disfl.uh> some really nice kind of souvenirs and gifts my <disfl.um> <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_570-581.wav|<breath> partner bought a nice watercolor painting of the <disfl.um> <disfl.uh> <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_581-593.wav|<breath> town hall christmas market that we had just been to <disfl.um> <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_593-618.wav|<breath> and yeah it was just a really nice feel in the city these markets were even open on christmas eve christmas day boxing day <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_618-641.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> likewise the <disfl.um> exhibition that we were going to see that <disfl.uh> we went on christmas day the museum was open <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_641-654.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> we also had a really lovely <disfl.um> christmas dinner at <disfl.uh> <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_11_74-109.wav|<breath> some of those christmas markets and we really loved it <breath> and we had read that <disfl.uh> vienna is supposed to have actually one of the best christmas markets <disfl.uh> in all of europe <breath>|27
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_0-11.wav|well what brings me to london is work <breath> and studies <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_106-122.wav|<breath> <breath> i know that <disfl.um> it's actually a lot better here than in other countries <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_11-27.wav|<breath> i'm actually from buckingham shore <breath> a nice little village called charles font st charles <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_122-138.wav|<breath> some things i like about london well i like some of the sites <disfl.um> parliament <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_138-148.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> westminster abbey <breath> going to the london eye <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_148-162.wav|<breath> tower of london <breath> <disfl.um> some things i do not like about london <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_162-170.wav|<breath> well i've spoken about the transport system <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_170-182.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i dare say the relative unfriendliness of london is <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_182-202.wav|<breath> but i suspect that's principally down to everybody just being in a rush to get from a to b <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_202-213.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> having to contend with various factors <breath> such as <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_213-224.wav|<breath> travel frustrating bus services <breath> tube services that aren't always <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_224-230.wav|<breath> punch all and <breath> delays <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_230-243.wav|<breath> caused by signaling systems being newly installed et cetera and the like <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_243-264.wav|<breath> okay do i have a favorite restaurants or cuisine well being a relatively uncultured individual i suppose i should say <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_264-275.wav|<breath> pizza hussle dominoes <breath> <disfl.um> is it available in london <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_27-37.wav|<breath> which is somewhere between jared's cross and high wickham <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_275-287.wav|<breath> yes it is available in london in various parts of london <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_287-313.wav|<breath> there are plenty of towns in london <breath> favorite <disfl.um> <breath> dominoes in london well the one i should say i visit more often than <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_313-321.wav|<breath> any other one possibly <breath> the one <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_321-330.wav|<breath> in <breath> wembley <breath> which is kind of <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_330-359.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> some would say middlesex but since that was abolished <breath> in the i think 1980s the by the glc or greater london council ken livingston etc etc <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_359-376.wav|<breath> the middlesex has been followed up by london so it's now considered part of greater london <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_37-46.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> near the chiltern escarpment if you like <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_376-394.wav|<breath> any <disfl.um> of the parks yes i've been to quite a few of the parks in london <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_394-407.wav|<breath> battersea parks nice one very spacious hyde park i like very much <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_407-422.wav|<breath> victoria park in the east end <breath> <disfl.um> whatever parks they're very nice parks <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_422-431.wav|<breath> king <disfl.um> george's park in wandsworth <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_431-444.wav|<breath> queens park near kilburn <breath> that's a pretty nice park as well <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_444-461.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but <breath> some of the better parks <breath> i would say are outside of london <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_46-62.wav|<breath> so what things do i like about london well the hustle and bustle i suppose <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_461-481.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i like barry no in oxford that's a very nice park florence park is possibly the best one <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_481-487.wav|<breath> that's in oxford <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_487-505.wav|<breath> i very much like <breath> some of the green spaces like i said in the villages well <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_505-519.wav|<breath> close to where i live chauffeur st giles <breath> sierra green jordan's village <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_519-524.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> gerard's cross beckonsfield <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_524-533.wav|<breath> if i met someone new to the city <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_533-543.wav|<breath> i would recommend <breath> they go to westminster abbey <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_543-553.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> go along <breath> the victoria <disfl.um> embankment <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_553-563.wav|<breath> it's a very nice walk as well <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_563-574.wav|<breath> the east end the docks the royal docks shadow limehouse <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_574-584.wav|<breath> <breath> <disfl.um> the whopping docks are very nice indeed <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_584-592.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> in the south of london <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_592-602.wav|<breath> on oak park is very nice as well near <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_602-608.wav|<breath> dodge the north of london <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_608-622.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> haven't been to the north of london too often as it happens <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_62-70.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i don't much like traffic <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_622-632.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> how about <breath> the west of london <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_70-90.wav|<breath> which is always heavy around here <breath> and everyone seems to be in a rush around london as well <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_12_90-106.wav|<breath> transport system is not the best diver even though obviously my origins are african so <breath>|28
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_0-29.wav|okay <disfl.um> i've always quite liked london most of my family is here so i guess i would say perhaps family <disfl.um> is the main reason but i also <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_116-137.wav|<breath> you can never really get bored i think <breath> <disfl.um> there are so many free museums and all galleries and <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_137-149.wav|<breath> of that <breath> in terms of what i don't like <disfl.um> <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_149-160.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> what would i say i don't like about london <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_160-198.wav|<breath> <breath> it's a bit too <breath> busy sometimes it can be a bit too fast paced i think so i think it needs to slow down sometimes it's a bit too fast and also i think people don't|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_199-229.wav|look out for each other as much as they should people can be unkind <disfl.um> but i guess it's a cultural thing i perhaps do it sometimes as well <disfl.um> <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_229-238.wav|<breath> <breath> yeah i would perhaps say that <disfl.uh> <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_238-239.wav|<breath> <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_239-240.wav|<breath> <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_240-248.wav|<breath> <breath> do i have a favorite restaurant <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_248-262.wav|<breath> not necessarily actually i wouldn't say i have a favorite restaurant in london <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_262-293.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah <breath> perhaps i need to get out to more restaurants to be able to make a <disfl.um> judgment on that but i wouldn't necessarily say i do <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_29-57.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> like the fact that it's so green and it's quite multicultural and there's just so much things to do <disfl.um> so many places to go so <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_293-296.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_296-321.wav|<breath> in terms of the parks as i said that's one of my favorite things about london i quite like the green spaces and i <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_321-335.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> would say my favorite i haven't been to all the parks but <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_335-352.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> if i were to ultimately choose a favorite one it would perhaps be hamsted heap <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_352-368.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> although richmond park is a close second but i really really like hamsted heap <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_368-369.wav|<breath> <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_369-406.wav|<breath> i would say try all the museums in the galleries i think there's just so much to learn they're so fascinating and they're also free which is not very common in other countries so i would say|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_407-425.wav|definitely for starters try all the museum museums and galleries and <disfl.um> yeah that would be my recommendation <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_425-427.wav|<breath> <breath> <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_427-439.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i haven't actually been to the london eye as yet <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_439-465.wav|<breath> but i have been <disfl.um> on the river thames the boat ride and you basically get a very nice view of all the monuments and <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_465-486.wav|<breath> basically all the attractions in london and <breath> it was nice i wouldn't say it was overrated necessarily but <disfl.um> <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_486-498.wav|<breath> i think it was just okay <disfl.um> it was a nice <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_498-503.wav|<breath> activity to do <disfl.um> <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_503-530.wav|<breath> but i would definitely like to try the london eye at some point <disfl.um> perhaps and perhaps madame tissues i've actually never been there as well <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_530-541.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but i think that would perhaps be overrated because <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_57-68.wav|<breath> yeah i would say say that's what brings me here <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_68-82.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> in terms of things i like about london i would say <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_13_82-116.wav|<breath> i like the green spaces and i also like the fact that there are so many restaurants and there's always something to do it never really sleeps there's always something to do so <breath>|29
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_0-12.wav|m <breath> i came to london about six years ago to study <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_114-128.wav|<breath> london is a melting pot with people from different cultures from different countries <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_12-27.wav|<breath> i had finished my high school studies and i wanted to come to university <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_128-143.wav|<breath> and funny things everything works here in london people get along with each other <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_143-157.wav|<breath> there's a sense of community and there's a sense of understanding even though <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_157-176.wav|<breath> people are probably not going to talk to you in the streets <breath> but if you need help <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_176-186.wav|<breath> there's a high chance that they will help you <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_186-202.wav|<breath> and <breath> i just really love that sense of spirit and that sense of understanding <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_202-221.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and some of the things i do not like about london is it is just too expensive <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_221-246.wav|<breath> the city is so <breath> expensive it feels like every time i breathe there's money coming out of my pocket going on an account <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_246-283.wav|<breath> it is not the best <breath> <disfl.um> another thing that i do not like about london is when traveling on the tube during peak times or rush hour it's just so full people have barely time people|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_27-40.wav|<breath> so i did two years of what they call six form here <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_284-316.wav|can barely breathe <breath> <disfl.um> but then again it ties back to the understanding that everyone understands that this is what you have to go through to live in this wonderful city <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_316-331.wav|<breath> <breath> so one of my favorite restaurants in london would have to be benihana <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_331-344.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> they have three locations in st paul's piccadilly and in chelsea <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_344-358.wav|<breath> i love benihana because it's japanese food and i absolutely love japanese food <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_358-371.wav|<breath> the seasoning the fresh fish the sushi the beef the teriyaki sauce <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_371-384.wav|<breath> is just absolutely amazing it's everything i could eat it every day <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_384-395.wav|<breath> but obviously it's too expensive so i can't <breath> and <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_395-417.wav|<breath> when it comes to parks in london i haven't been to that many parks in london i've been to hyde park <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_40-66.wav|<breath> in which i did math physics and economics <breath> after that i went to university in another part of london in another part of england <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_417-464.wav|<breath> and i've been to regents park <breath> and these are really nice parks during the summer you can sit down and have a meal or just look at the view and just take it all in so it's a really great experience <disfl.um> between the two <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_464-481.wav|<breath> i think i would probably go for hyde park just because you can get to harrods <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_481-497.wav|<breath> quite <breath> fast i think you get to <breath> harris from regent park as well <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_497-531.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> yeah i've never done it but i think you should be able to because they're quite close to each other <disfl.um> so if someone you came to london and had to recommend <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_531-544.wav|<breath> somewhere <disfl.um> for them to <breath> go wow i would probably recommend <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_544-559.wav|<breath> the tourist attractions such as <disfl.um> buckingham palace and big ben obviously hyde park <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_559-589.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> just for them to be london eye the shard <breath> just for them to kind of see london from a tourist perspective and to experience the culture that <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_589-604.wav|<breath> london has to offer i'd also take some to you know some of the <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_604-617.wav|<breath> not so touristy parts but parts that have such great street food <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_617-649.wav|<breath> such as an area shortage hackney or i should have a canary wolf as well because that's really really nice it's like the business district of london where all the big <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_649-663.wav|<breath> some of the big corporations and some of the big banks are located <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_66-83.wav|<breath> and so i left london for a few years <breath> and then now i've come back <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_663-676.wav|<breath> and <breath> i haven't been to <breath> that many notorious attractions myself <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_676-712.wav|<breath> in london just because i don't know i feel like when you live here you always have this thing at the back of your head that i could always go so i bother go today <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_83-92.wav|<breath> to work and to finish up my studies <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_14_92-114.wav|<breath> one of the things the few things that i do like about london is the level of diversity that london brings <breath>|30
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_0-12.wav|<disfl.um> okay <breath> so things that i like favorite restaurant <disfl.oh> actually <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_101-118.wav|<breath> into a different <disfl.um> <breath> universe <disfl.uh> you could say with all these the toilets in <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_118-138.wav|<breath> the form of white pods <breath> also what i liked about the restaurant it was so tasty very very <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_12-26.wav|<breath> favorite <disfl.ah> restaurant <disfl.um> <breath> i went to sketch <disfl.ah> the other day <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_138-149.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> incredible <disfl.um> the best what did i think <breath> <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_149-164.wav|<breath> pan fried sea baths which are smoked that i've ever tried in my life <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_164-177.wav|<breath> so the food was absolutely amazing the service <breath> was also <disfl.um> <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_177-187.wav|<breath> <breath> very <disfl.um> polite very spot on <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_187-200.wav|<breath> <breath> it's <disfl.um> a modern british cuisine you could say so european <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_200-213.wav|<breath> fare and <breath> anybody can go and book in the different restaurants <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_213-227.wav|<breath> okay so like some <disfl.uh> things <disfl.um> i about london the fact that <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_227-242.wav|<breath> there's a lot of things to do there's lots of cultural pursuits they say <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_242-261.wav|<breath> you could never be bored in a place like london what you do not like about it it's <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_26-34.wav|<breath> which had an amazing ambience and ethereal <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_261-273.wav|<breath> not a <disfl.um> very relaxing place to be it's quite aggressive <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_273-279.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.uh> so <breath> <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_279-301.wav|<breath> if you want to have relaxation <breath> it's better to live outside of london and then to come inside to london <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_301-311.wav|<breath> if you have to work <breath> favorite <disfl.ah> parks <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_311-315.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> do i <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_315-331.wav|<breath> have a favorite park <disfl.um> i like how hyde park during the winter wonderland time <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_331-340.wav|<breath> because <breath> it has all these amazing activities <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_34-51.wav|<breath> ambience as if you're in another world if each room has a different color and different <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_340-352.wav|<breath> to do <breath> and gives a very christmassy sort of feel <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_352-358.wav|<breath> <breath> <disfl.um> any tourist attraction <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_358-368.wav|<breath> i like i <breath> think the tower of london <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_368-384.wav|<breath> has the best tourist attraction <breath> <breath> you could spend the whole day in there <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_384-401.wav|<breath> and there's lots of <disfl.um> things to see <breath> lots of interactives to take part in <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_401-413.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and <disfl.um> you get the very tasty sausage rolls <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_413-427.wav|<breath> and sausage <disfl.um> <disfl.um> <breath> and pies over there i find as well <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_427-443.wav|<breath> if someone is new would you recommend so i recommend they go see tariff london <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_443-470.wav|<breath> i recommend if they want to go on a tour you can go in an afternoon tea london bus that takes you around while serving you <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_470-483.wav|<breath> on afternoon tea what is it called bmb's <disfl.um> bakery i think <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_483-499.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i'd recommend you go and hang out in <breath> covent garden to see all <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_499-514.wav|<breath> the energy and the vibe and all the <breath> theatrical performances and the cute <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_51-66.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> amazing <disfl.um> decor so <breath> the orientalist section makes you feel a bit <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_514-523.wav|<breath> independent shops that still are in covent garden <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_523-536.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i'd recommend to go <breath> to greenwich which is like a <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_536-554.wav|<breath> hidden part of london people don't go out to sea so much you get the best advantage <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_554-570.wav|<breath> from <disfl.um> east greenwich meridian line you walk up the hill to the astronomy museum <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_570-579.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and you can have the best view <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_579-589.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> of london and then alter to experience maritime <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_589-598.wav|<breath> london <disfl.uh> where kuti going to the sark <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_598-618.wav|<breath> an old tea clipper ship <breath> and it feels like you're in continental europe not really like in london <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_66-77.wav|<breath> that <disfl.uh> you're actually in china <breath> and then the <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_77-89.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> lose the toilets are amazing because they're like space pods <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/test_15_89-101.wav|<breath> so you go upstairs to a separate section if you're entering <breath>|31
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_0-15.wav|so i'm in london right now because i am doing a phd in cognitive neuroscience <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_121-142.wav|<breath> <breath> so <disfl.uh> some of the things i like about london <disfl.um> i think it has really really great community <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_142-164.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i know it's cliche to say that london is vibrant but it really is <disfl.um> it's so multicultural multilingual <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_15-40.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i was living in cambridge when i was doing my masters degree and i was really interested in studying here in london <disfl.uh> <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_164-172.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> people look after each other i've <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_172-192.wav|<breath> been on the tube or the bus so many times where someone's needed help and people rush in <disfl.um> <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_192-211.wav|<breath> yeah so i really appreciate how people look after each other and the sense of community and solidarity <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_211-236.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> it kind of <breath> almost feels like the utopian dream sometimes the way that we can all work together in this big city <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_236-276.wav|<breath> so some of the things i don't like about london <breath> are <disfl.um> there's pretty extreme inequality here so you see really poor people lots of rough sleepers and then you also see people who are like oil tycoons and|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_277-292.wav|finance people and it's sad that <disfl.um> there's so much inequality in the society here <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_292-304.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and i'm also not a big fan of the pollution <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_304-316.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> it takes its toll on your quality of life <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_316-339.wav|<breath> <breath> <disfl.um> in terms of favorite food or cuisine in london i am a big fan of indian and bangladeshi food <disfl.um> <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_339-362.wav|<breath> there's lots of great stuff here in london although i've been told birmingham is the place to go for really good indian <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_362-373.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i also have a few favorite chinese restaurants basically <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_373-383.wav|<breath> you can get any cuisine you want in london <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_383-411.wav|<breath> <breath> have i been to any of the parks in london <disfl.uh> yes so i go to parks all the time i like to run and i <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_40-50.wav|<breath> because ucl is a really great school for neuroscience <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_411-428.wav|<breath> tend <disfl.uh> to run in places like hampstead heath the most because it's a big park <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_428-444.wav|<breath> lots of nature especially given the pollution in london it's a really nice place to <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_444-453.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> sort of reconnect with trees and greenery <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_453-471.wav|<breath> if i met someone new to the city i would definitely recommend they check out the parks <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_471-494.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> or just walk around the neighborhoods like leave the center of the city because the tourist stuff is really impressive <disfl.um> <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_494-523.wav|<breath> it's definitely worth walking along south bank for example but i think where london really shines is the small neighborhoods places i didn't discover until i moved here <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_50-66.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> it's highly productive there's lots of really interesting stuff going on lots of talks <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_523-543.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> in terms of tourist attractions i did go because someone took me as a guest to the dungeons <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_543-555.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> so i went in with pretty low expectations <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_555-569.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but i actually ended up having a pretty good time it was <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_569-593.wav|<breath> spooky <breath> sure <disfl.um> but mostly it was actually pretty entertaining especially given <disfl.um> the actors who kind of jump out at you <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_593-613.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> wouldn't say they try and kind of make it like edutainment and you learn about london's history <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_613-620.wav|<breath> i don't know how successfully but <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_620-633.wav|<breath> i feel like if you're with someone who really wants to go <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_66-83.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> and it just seemed like a good place to apply and my supervisor at cambridge <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_83-96.wav|<breath> strongly <disfl.uh> recommended that i get in touch with my current supervisor <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_00_96-121.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> here at ucl <breath> and one thing led to another and <disfl.um> now i'm here and i've been here for three years now <breath>|32
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_0-37.wav|what brings me to london <breath> i have lived in london since 2008 when i came down with my family from paul which is an area of england all the way down south it's next to bournemouth <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_112-127.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> well i went to one of the worst schools in southeast london <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_127-141.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so i have been chased by gangs <breath> that wasn't the most <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_141-146.wav|<breath> amazing time <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_146-161.wav|<breath> other than that the whole crime aspect of london needs to be sorted out <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_161-170.wav|<breath> but yeah london's not bad at all do <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_170-182.wav|<breath> you have a favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath> no not at <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_182-202.wav|<breath> all though i do like this one restaurant in the two called jimmy's i believe it's called jimmy's international <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_202-216.wav|<breath> just like this whole <breath> <disfl.uh> all you can eat buffet type place <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_216-229.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and it's decently cheap especially for being in the o two <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_229-243.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> been to any have you of the parks in london no i <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_243-267.wav|<breath> think i've been to about two no <breath> if you met someone new to the city what would you recommend them go see <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_267-289.wav|<breath> to be fair despite living in london for so long i have not really been to any of the main attractions <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_289-302.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> mainly because i just had no interest as did my friends <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_302-316.wav|<breath> though i would recommend them to go see the museums i guess <disfl.um> <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_316-330.wav|<breath> other than that just take some sort of bus tour of the city <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_330-341.wav|<breath> have you been to any tourist attractions <breath> <disfl.uh> the <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_341-356.wav|<breath> only one i've been to as of recent i think is the british museum <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_356-368.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i kind of enjoyed it <disfl.ah> it wasn't overrated <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_368-394.wav|<breath> there's a <disfl.uh> lot on display then again there was a lot that they didn't show about three sections were cut off in the public <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_37-48.wav|<breath> it's super sunny there's a <breath> rocky i think beach <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_394-396.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_396-400.wav|<breath> so <breath> just <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_400-421.wav|<breath> general questions then <disfl.um> or topic <disfl.ah> i am currently doing my phd at ucl <disfl.um> at the icn i'm <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_421-437.wav|<breath> essentially trying to conduct research into asmr <breath> which is the autonomous sensory meridian response <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_437-451.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i'm interested in asmr <breath> because it is something that has <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_451-474.wav|<breath> had a lack of scientific interest <breath> <disfl.uh> even in recent years there has only currently been four fmri studies done on <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_474-486.wav|<breath> it and one physiological study focused on heart rate and skin <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_48-62.wav|<breath> but bournemouth was super cool <breath> <disfl.um> some things you like about london <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_486-495.wav|<breath> conductance so <disfl.ah> doing another one would essentially <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_495-504.wav|<breath> kind of bolster the research base <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_504-514.wav|<breath> but in my terms i would link it to <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_514-524.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> sort of unexplored aspects of sound processing <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_524-536.wav|<breath> in <disfl.uh> particular <breath> cross modal processing within the auditory system <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_536-560.wav|<breath> and in particular again in the corridor auditory fields <breath> where there is sort of underexplored spatial and smat sensory aspects of it <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_560-576.wav|<breath> in which asmr is a prime candidate to actually <breath> try and explore that further <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_576-590.wav|<breath> so that is the plan <disfl.um> i guess interests for myself would be <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_590-596.wav|<breath> gaming drawing <breath> sometimes painting <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_596-616.wav|<breath> sort <disfl.um> of games i like <disfl.ah> open world <disfl.um> rpg so i can spend a lot of time <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_616-626.wav|<breath> and essentially escapism <breath> from other stuff essentially uni <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_62-72.wav|<breath> i like how it's got multiple cultures in one <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_72-85.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i like the transport it takes you everywhere you don't need <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_85-93.wav|<breath> a car i guess <breath> i <disfl.uh> <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_02_93-112.wav|<breath> like that all my friends are in london <breath> what are some things you don't like about london <breath>|34
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_0-14.wav|<disfl.uh> so i moved to london in 2010 when i started university at ucl <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_116-161.wav|<breath> do anything you want anytime you want <disfl.um> so there's never a boring weekend there's always something more to go and see or to go and look at or that you haven't visited before even if you're revisiting things that <disfl.ah> you really like <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_14-50.wav|<breath> so first i studied speech and language therapy and i did the undergraduate program which <disfl.uh> was four years so before that i lived in working which isn't too far away from <disfl.uh> london anyway <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_161-181.wav|<breath> i also love that it's really easy <disfl.um> to get around town so there's loads of ways to travel <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_181-201.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> on the overground and underground and on the buses so it's really easy to get out and about <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_201-229.wav|<breath> the <disfl.uh> other thing i love is that <disfl.um> they have lots of <disfl.ah> vegan options in london so <disfl.um> i became vegan in january this year <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_229-244.wav|<breath> and i found that there's so many options <disfl.um> available in and around london <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_244-275.wav|<breath> but these kind of reduce quite a lot when you go out of london so it's really great that all these they have <disfl.um> options available on <disfl.uh> your doorstep <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_275-310.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> some things i don't like about london i hate my commute so <disfl.uh> i have to commute in from west london every day <disfl.um> and it takes me about an hour each way <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_310-333.wav|<breath> and it's definitely the worst part of my day <disfl.um> i hate having to go home in the dark in the evening <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_333-346.wav|<breath> on the tube and then walk another 10 minutes in the rain <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_346-383.wav|<breath> i'd love to live a bit closer but i can't <disfl.uh> what else did i like about london <disfl.um> it's really busy all of the time <disfl.um> you can't stand still anywhere because there's always someone <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_383-412.wav|<breath> trying to get past you <disfl.um> but i also really like that aspect of london that it is busy and there's always a good atmosphere wherever you go <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_412-459.wav|<breath> <breath> <breath> <disfl.um> i don't really have a favorite restaurant in london <disfl.um> tend to eat in quite a few different places don't tend to go back to the same place <disfl.um> but like i said i'm vegan so always looking for new places to try <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_459-501.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but i typically tend to be in east london which is kind of annoying because i live in west london so it's a little bit of a track there <disfl.ah> to go and visit <disfl.uh> a few of those places <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_50-72.wav|<breath> <breath> <disfl.um> but after that i moved away from london for <disfl.um> another two years and move back home to woking <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_501-544.wav|<breath> <breath> if <disfl.uh> i met someone new in the city i'd probably recommend <disfl.um> that they go and visit all the different <disfl.um> kind of little suburbs in london so kind of north london is obviously really different from <disfl.um> south and east|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_545-566.wav|london <breath> and they all got their own character and their all own <disfl.um> vibe going on so it would be <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_566-615.wav|<breath> kind of <disfl.um> amiss if you didn't go and see all of those different areas to get a real feel for the city and <disfl.um> i say get out of central london <disfl.um> get out of all the tourist traps and just go and see where people live <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_615-637.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and go and see some of the smaller areas and have a little wander around and you'll always find something <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_637-667.wav|<breath> interesting to do <breath> <disfl.um> i haven't actually been to that many of the tourist attractions <disfl.um> i think i've been on the london eye about ten years ago <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_667-690.wav|<breath> and <disfl.um> went to the london dungeons otherwise tend to try and avoid them because they're always very busy and very expensive <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_690-728.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <breath> london i was good maybe a little overrated maybe a little overpriced but it is an icon and so i can see why people would want to come here and have a go on it|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_72-84.wav|<breath> and then move back again well <disfl.um> about three years ago <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_84-98.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> back to chisel so now i live in <disfl.um> london full time <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_03_98-116.wav|<breath> <breath> so <disfl.uh> some things i like about london <disfl.um> i love that you can kind of <breath>|35
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_0-5.wav|i came to london <disfl.um> <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_111-121.wav|<breath> in ways things that i do like <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_121-132.wav|<breath> <breath> there's a great deal available to you <disfl.um> at <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_132-139.wav|<breath> great convenience <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> there's <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_139-151.wav|<breath> anything you want any kind of food or whatever you need <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_151-162.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> you don't have to get in a car and <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_162-175.wav|<breath> <breath> drive a half hour to get there everything's very close by <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_17-26.wav|<breath> initially <breath> <disfl.uh> for <breath> the masters program <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_175-191.wav|<breath> that makes things convenient <breath> i like that <disfl.um> <breath> there's a lot to do <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_191-203.wav|<breath> there's a lot to still explore <breath> there's tons of museums <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_203-216.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> there's a lot of restaurants i like to go to <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_216-230.wav|<breath> a number of restaurants particularly monkas <disfl.um> i would say my favorite is <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_230-239.wav|<breath> probably franco <breath> they have really good pizza <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_239-243.wav|<breath> and <breath> i <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_243-255.wav|<breath> have also explored a lot of different parks <disfl.uh> in london <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_255-261.wav|<breath> such as hyde park and <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_26-38.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> in cognitive neuroscience at the institute of cognitive neuroscience at <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_261-271.wav|<breath> russell square gardens and <breath> <disfl.uh> regents park and <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_271-285.wav|<breath> there's tons of parks if i had to choose a favorite <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_285-297.wav|<breath> i really like hyde park <breath> and i would maybe say <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_297-312.wav|<breath> that's my favorite in london at least <breath> there's a lot in the uk <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_312-323.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if someone was new <breath> to the city <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_323-329.wav|<breath> i would <breath> recommend that <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_329-339.wav|<breath> they see <breath> a number of different sites and <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_339-347.wav|<breath> things such as museums and <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_347-357.wav|<breath> those are always really interesting they're free <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_357-376.wav|<breath> some of it can be boring but you just got to <breath> explore around and figure out what <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_376-388.wav|<breath> interests you <disfl.uh> and what you like i really like the <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_38-44.wav|<breath> ucl <breath> and <breath> i've <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_388-399.wav|<breath> british library going there for the first time is really <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_399-405.wav|<breath> cool they have <breath> <breath> <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_405-419.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> artifact treasure room there that has all sorts of really <breath> interesting <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_419-427.wav|<breath> old objects books and <breath> literature and <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_427-437.wav|<breath> paintings <disfl.um> <breath> and i would also probably recommend <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_437-446.wav|<breath> that <breath> someone new to london visit the <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_44-53.wav|<breath> stayed in london <breath> <breath> to continue <disfl.um> <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_446-457.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> british library <disfl.uh> not the british library the <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_457-470.wav|<breath> british <disfl.um> museum <breath> that's just across from russell square gardens it's <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_470-481.wav|<breath> massive you could spend days in there i've been there <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_481-502.wav|<breath> maybe three times and <breath> there's still all sorts of different rooms and exhibits i haven't even gotten to yet <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_5-17.wav|<breath> to go to school <breath> to go to university college london <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_502-504.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_504-505.wav|<breath> <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_505-511.wav|<breath> also the more touristy attractions <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_511-523.wav|<breath> such as the london eye which i haven't been to yet <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_53-68.wav|<breath> in cognitive neuroscience by doing a <breath> phd <disfl.uh> program here at the icn <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_68-75.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> on my second year now <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_75-86.wav|<breath> and i'll probably stay in london until i'm finished and <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_86-96.wav|<breath> there's a few things i like about london <disfl.um> <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_04_96-111.wav|<breath> <breath> at first <breath> the things that i didn't like so much are now <breath>|36
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_0-27.wav|<disfl.um> i was born in london i've been <breath> in west london for all of my life i'm 27 now i was born in hillingdon hospital in <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_103-119.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> what are some of the things i don't like about london it's very crowded <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_119-146.wav|<breath> i don't do well in crowds it can be really gloomy especially in the winter which seems to last for about nine months of the year <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_146-161.wav|<breath> it rains a lot <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> also i don't like that it's quite <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_161-177.wav|<breath> gray <breath> in terms of even the buildings and the pavements and everything is gray <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_177-210.wav|<breath> except in the summer it's fine <disfl.um> the one thing that is good though is that you can easily get to green spaces apparently there are so many trees in london that <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_210-220.wav|<breath> it would actually officially be counted as a forest <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_220-237.wav|<breath> but obviously they're not all in the same place so it doesn't always feel like that <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_237-246.wav|<breath> do i have a favorite restaurant m i'm <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_246-248.wav|<breath> <breath> <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_248-252.wav|<breath> not sure actually <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_252-271.wav|<breath> have i been to any of the parks in london and do i have a favorite park yes <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_27-66.wav|<breath> hounslow which is in west london and it is on one end of the piccadilly line near to heathrow airport some of the things i like about london are <disfl.ah> that it's very easy to get around you <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_271-297.wav|<breath> i do it's actually not one of the big ones my favorite park is austerly park which again is in west london where i live <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_297-317.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> you can get to that on the piccadilly line as well if you stop at austerally station <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_317-351.wav|<breath> but it's one of their national trust properties <breath> and it's a bit out of the way so it doesn't get a lot of people going there but it's got a big house <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_351-389.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> really big grounds it used to belong to a family who i think owned most of that area but they've <disfl.um> just turned the park bit of it into national trust property it's got a lake <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_389-409.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and a river and you can go canoeing on the river and they have like swans and ducks <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_409-437.wav|<breath> they also have rabbits and if you go during <breath> about the end of march beginning of april you can usually see baby ducks and baby rabbits <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_437-450.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so it's really nice they also have cows horses chickens because <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_450-465.wav|<breath> they have a small working farm on the park <breath> so it's quite fun <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_465-476.wav|<breath> if someone was new to the city i would say <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_476-484.wav|<breath> probably go and see the parks because <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_484-496.wav|<breath> they're a good escape from the general hustle and bustle and <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_496-534.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> sometimes you need a break from that i'd say do all the touristy things because some of them are quite fun and i think especially if you live here and you've been here a long time <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_534-576.wav|<breath> you do miss out on doing those we also have lots of nice museums <disfl.um> and you can usually spend an entire day walking around one museum one particular thing that i like doing is every year they have the national <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_576-604.wav|<breath> photographer <breath> the nature photographer of the year and they present all the pictures in the natural history museum and that's always good to go and see <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_604-633.wav|<breath> i haven't really been to any of the tourist attractions like the london eye we went on school trips so i've been to like madame to swords and <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_633-656.wav|<breath> the london dungeons and stuff like that <breath> <disfl.um> generally i'd say they are probably overrated i like more than nature stuff <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_656-673.wav|<breath> and parks and things like that and also <breath> going around museums at my own pace <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_66-83.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> can <breath> meet lots of different people people from all around the world and <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_673-682.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> other things to do in london <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_682-703.wav|<breath> would include <breath> i think one thing that i'm interested in doing is just going to random stations because sometimes <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_703-723.wav|<breath> when you're on a line so for example i take the big daily line every single day to work <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_83-94.wav|<breath> try a lot of different things <disfl.um> particularly food music <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_05_94-103.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> traveling is very easy from here <breath>|37
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_0-25.wav|so i moved to london because my partner is studying at university of college london he is working on getting his phd in cognitive neuroscience <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_112-124.wav|<breath> and i had to <breath> go through an entire process to <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_124-140.wav|<breath> get my nursing license and my visa in order <breath> and now i work here <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_140-153.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> in reading as a nurse <breath> i work on a diabetes <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_153-169.wav|<breath> rheumatology ward <breath> which is <disfl.um> very different than the nursing i used to do <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_169-180.wav|<breath> i was previously a nurse in the intensive care unit <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_180-190.wav|<breath> and often worked with <breath> patients after cardiac surgeries <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_190-208.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> ear nose and throat surgeries <breath> as well as various medical conditions like respiratory failure <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_208-224.wav|<breath> and now i'm dealing primarily with <breath> medical patients who are generally not as sick <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_224-236.wav|<breath> and <disfl.um> <breath> my patient workload is much larger as well <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_236-256.wav|<breath> i was previously only working with <breath> two to three patients and now i work with an average of <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_25-40.wav|<breath> and we decided that it would be fun if i moved here as well <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_256-268.wav|<breath> eight to ten patients <breath> which is quite a large difference <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_268-284.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so it was a very large adjustment period when i first came here <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_284-298.wav|<breath> i had to <breath> adjust first of all just to having more patients <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_298-307.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so there's a lot of prioritization and <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_307-319.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> delegation that i needed to quickly learn in order to <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_319-329.wav|<breath> be efficient and practice safe <breath> <disfl.uh> nursing care <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_329-341.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but luckily i have been working with a great team <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_341-364.wav|<breath> and the team that i work with are from several different countries the nhs is currently having a massive nursing shortage so <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_364-379.wav|<breath> they often bring in nurses from the eu <breath> as well as other countries <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_379-394.wav|<breath> <breath> the agency i went through is <breath> <disfl.um> actually based in the philippines <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_394-408.wav|<breath> and so <breath> there is a large philippine <breath> population at our hospital <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_40-57.wav|<breath> so i came from the united states <breath> and i have been living here now since <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_408-417.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> as well as people from spain portugal <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_417-427.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> all over africa <breath> and america surprisingly as <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_427-442.wav|<breath> i have yet to meet another american nurse <breath> <disfl.um> but that's all right <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_442-460.wav|<breath> <disfl.ah> so it's been <breath> it's been fun getting to know everyone from all these different countries <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_460-474.wav|<breath> and to have people with sort of a similar experience <breath> so <disfl.um> <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_474-484.wav|<breath> that definitely helped with my transition period <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_484-493.wav|<breath> and now they are great friends <breath> and <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_493-504.wav|<breath> <breath> recently <disfl.um> i got to experience what the nhs <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_504-520.wav|<breath> is like as a patient because i had <breath> a very severe chest infection and <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_520-538.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i had to go in an e <breath> and for <disfl.um> a temperature of 40 <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_538-557.wav|<breath> and my heart rate was over 130 <breath> and they nearly admitted me to the hospital but luckily <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_557-570.wav|<breath> i got a little better with some fluids and <breath> iv antibiotics <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_57-62.wav|<breath> the 29 january 2019 <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_570-576.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but <breath> it <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_576-582.wav|<breath> was very <disfl.um> interesting because <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_582-592.wav|<breath> of <breath> i had never even seen my vp <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_592-603.wav|<breath> yet let alone go to ame so i was messaging <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_603-617.wav|<breath> all my coworkers all my friends trying to figure out what to do <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_617-632.wav|<breath> and they were a great support system during that time which was really nice <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_62-75.wav|<breath> so almost full year <breath> <disfl.um> it's been a very exciting journey <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_75-87.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> it took me <breath> approximately eight or nine months <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_87-98.wav|<breath> to be able to make the move happen <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_06_98-112.wav|<breath> i worked as a nurse back home <breath> <disfl.um> for almost two years <breath>|38
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_0-12.wav|okay <breath> so i came to london to do a master's degree <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_106-130.wav|<breath> or just quite interesting getting to go in there and meet her friends because she's friends with all these interesting artists and illustrators <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_12-27.wav|<breath> and <breath> i grew up in dublin but my dad is actually english so <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_130-141.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and i really like england so far it's <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_141-178.wav|<breath> really really big and there's just so much going on all the time <breath> so many different events it's quite overwhelming really you can't keep up with them all and you want to see everything i <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_178-205.wav|<breath> <breath> really like <disfl.uh> the other day i saw <disfl.uh> the parakeets in the park and i'd heard about them but i hadn't seen them and <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_205-236.wav|<breath> it's just really nice unexpected <breath> <breath> wacky kind of thing and it kind of fits the city i think that there are wild parakeets even there though shouldn't be <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_236-254.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i don't like how <breath> big london is in a way just because it takes about <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_254-281.wav|<breath> an hour to get to the other side or even further like anywhere you want to go on the weekend you have to travel for ages <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_27-49.wav|<breath> i <disfl.um> actually have some family in england so it's quite nice coming over to see them because we never <disfl.um> <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_281-303.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and i'm not used to that because it takes like 2 hours to cross ireland entirely so it just <disfl.um> <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_303-317.wav|<breath> seems a bit ridiculous i've never spent that long in public transport i <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_317-326.wav|<breath> <breath> really like all the market food stalls <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_326-340.wav|<breath> and all the different types of cuisine because again we didn't have that <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_340-359.wav|<breath> in <disfl.uh> ireland it's just like crafty mexicans with burritos or italian but there isn't really much variety <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_359-370.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and i found this really nice malaysian restaurant <disfl.ah> <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_370-391.wav|<breath> by houston station last week <breath> <disfl.um> and it looks like fast food restaurant and it looks like it's real <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_391-412.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> tacky and <disfl.uh> not great food but <disfl.uh> then when you get in there it's actually unbelievable food and <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_412-445.wav|<breath> it was really cheap <breath> <breath> i haven't been to too many of the parks and i have a list on my phone of all the parks i need to go to <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_445-457.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> particularly i really want to go to hamster teeth and <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_457-492.wav|<breath> <disfl.ah> try to go swimming <breath> and i don't think i'm going to get to do it before i go home but i had intended on trying to go for a cold swim because <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_49-61.wav|<breath> <breath> really were that close with them which is quite bad <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_492-520.wav|<breath> <breath> at christmas in dublin every year we have to jump in the sea and it's really cold so i was going to try and prepare for <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_520-537.wav|<breath> that <disfl.ah> so i don't <disfl.uh> look like too much of a wimp when i'm nervously <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_537-549.wav|<breath> <breath> edging in in front of all my friends but <disfl.um> <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_549-582.wav|<breath> yeah i don't think i'll get around to that <disfl.um> <breath> and apparently there's like a swan out there as well so i'd like to check that out it sounds quite cool <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_582-590.wav|<breath> i <breath> went to winter wonderland in <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_590-600.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> hyde park <breath> and that was an experience <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_600-622.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> it was definitely very christmassy <disfl.um> <breath> it was really nice because it was my birthday and people from home <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_61-77.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and i'm actually living with my uncle at the moment for this year <disfl.um> <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_622-638.wav|<breath> flew over to visit me so <breath> <disfl.uh> i went in there with them and <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_638-683.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> we couldn't get in for ages because the queue was really big so then by the time we did get in it was just full of really drunk adults and there was not a child inside even though it was a big fairground <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_683-698.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so that was quite fun we got a lot of mold wine <disfl.um> <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_698-707.wav|<breath> and yeah very <disfl.uh> touristy but good event <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_707-721.wav|<breath> and if i met someone new to the city what would i recommend <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_721-767.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> one thing i've been obsessed with is <breath> <disfl.um> and i think i need to stop going because it's getting a bit much but every time the tape modern has a late night like the last friday of every month i always go <disfl.um> <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_767-782.wav|<breath> and people are telling me i need to stop going to the tape but <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_77-92.wav|<breath> so it's quite nice to get to know them better because they're really nice <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_07_92-106.wav|<breath> and my auntie has an antique shop <breath> <disfl.um> so it's quite exciting <breath>|39
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_0-17.wav|i've lived in london since i was born <breath> <disfl.um> i've lived here my whole life and <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_101-113.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> something else i like about london a lot is that <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_113-133.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> there's always something going on <breath> so you can always find something to do if you want to <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_133-151.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and there's kind of unique stuff that doesn't happen so much in other places like <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_151-172.wav|<breath> there's always some new kind of shop opening or <breath> a new kind of event happening or something like that <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_17-33.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <disfl.um> so i'm <breath> a little bit sort of blase about it i guess <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_172-197.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but there's <breath> a few things i don't like about london so i think my least favorite thing is that there's not <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_197-209.wav|<breath> much green space so <breath> <breath> i definitely like to be <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_209-222.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> in london <breath> but just with more greenery and more nature <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_222-238.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> that's my least favorite thing but i also don't like how it's <disfl.um> <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_238-258.wav|<breath> so busy that sometimes people don't take the time to talk to each other or even notice each other <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_258-273.wav|<breath> <breath> and <disfl.um> <breath> they just sort of go about their business every day <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_273-296.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so <breath> i would say that <disfl.um> overall i really like london but it definitely has its ups and downs <disfl.um> <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_296-319.wav|<breath> and if i move out of london i'd like to go somewhere with a sort of more of a small community feel <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_319-337.wav|<breath> and definitely more access to <breath> nature like mountains or forests or lakes or stuff like that <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_33-53.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i don't <breath> see as many benefits as some people do but i do still like the city <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_337-345.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so my favorite cuisine is <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_345-359.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> like japanese food there's quite a lot of it available in london <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_359-371.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> but i <breath> have a favorite restaurant as well <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_371-383.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> it's probably tokyo dinah which is near leicester square <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_383-394.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and it does really really nice vegetarian japanese food <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_394-414.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so i've and vegetarian as well and it's sometimes quite difficult to find japanese food without fish <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_414-438.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> or pork so <breath> yeah i really appreciate that <disfl.um> they do really good like food with <disfl.um> tofu or with <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_438-451.wav|<breath> other sort of vegetarian substitutes <disfl.um> that don't have meat or fish <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_451-466.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and my favorite food that they do there is the tofu katsu curry <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_466-488.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i've been to a lot of parks in london but i definitely want to explore them more my <disfl.um> <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_488-511.wav|<breath> <breath> favorite is probably hampshire heath just because it's so big and there are so many dogs there i really like dogs <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_511-532.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so yeah my favorite is probably hampstead heath but i haven't actually been to richmond park which is <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_53-71.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> some things that i like most about london <disfl.um> is the people so i think <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_532-571.wav|<breath> kind of crazy because i've lived here all my life but <breath> yeah <disfl.uh> i kind of always feel like i will do it one day but just never sort of get round to it because i just <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_571-593.wav|<breath> i know it's sort of not going to go anywhere <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> so i definitely want to do that <disfl.um> <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_593-613.wav|<breath> st james's park is also really nice i like the water there and the birds and stuff like that <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_613-637.wav|<breath> that's <disfl.um> <breath> something i really like about london as well even though it's <disfl.um> an urban environment there's a lot of birds <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_637-653.wav|<breath> and in the morning you can hear bird song and things which is very nice <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_653-687.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if i met someone that was new to the city i would definitely recommend they go to the heath in fact whenever someone's visiting i always recommend they go there because <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_687-705.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> quite a few people visit london but don't know about the heath <disfl.um> hansen heath so <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_705-723.wav|<breath> i think it's really nice and there's so much of it to explore and get to know <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_71-83.wav|<breath> the rest range of people in london is <disfl.um> really unique <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_723-753.wav|<breath> and <disfl.um> it's kind of a way you can <breath> feel like you're away from the busyness of the city <disfl.um> while being still very much within the city <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_08_83-101.wav|<breath> and i love <disfl.um> getting to know people from different places and with different experiences and things <breath>|40
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_0-15.wav|<disfl.um> <breath> i've come to london because i'm doing a master's at university college london <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_118-135.wav|<breath> and the rest of the time i spend in the icn doing my master's research project <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_135-154.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> we're looking at <breath> mentalizing abilities in children with genetic syndromes compared to children with autism <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_15-27.wav|<breath> i'm studying applied pediatric neuropsychology in the institute of child health <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_154-160.wav|<breath> and typically developing children <breath> <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_160-170.wav|<breath> <breath> i don't know what to say i'm sorry <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_170-172.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_172-181.wav|<breath> okay i'll just read them through i guess <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_181-196.wav|<breath> so are you going to tell me when a minute's up or <breath> okay <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_196-206.wav|<breath> <breath> i'll just do the next question then <disfl.um> <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_206-239.wav|<breath> so some things i like about london <disfl.um> is do there's a <disfl.um> lot to i like going to watch bands play and <disfl.um> there's lots of that going on in london <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_239-250.wav|<breath> it's easy to travel quite far because of the tube <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_250-264.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i don't like the tube though it's really crowded and gross <disfl.um> <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_264-281.wav|<breath> i don't like how expensive london is <breath> i don't like how it's not very green <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_27-54.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i'm in london because i live near london and i can't afford to do a master's far away from home and i have to commute <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_281-286.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> my favorite <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_286-305.wav|<breath> cuisine is indian food and yeah there's loads of indian restaurants in london especially in like brixton area <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_305-319.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i have been to some parks in london bid to hyde park <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_319-337.wav|<breath> and green park <disfl.um> <breath> i don't think i really have a favorite though they're just parks <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_337-348.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> although hyde park is cool when winter wonderlands there <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_348-359.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if i met someone new to the city <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_359-373.wav|<breath> <breath> i would recommend they see the main tourist attractions like the <disfl.um> <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_373-388.wav|<breath> big ben <breath> and <breath> the london eye and buckingham palace stuff like that <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_388-407.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i have been to those tourist attractions i never been on the london eye though i <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_407-422.wav|<breath> think they're okay but you get used to them when you live here <breath> <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_422-426.wav|<breath> <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_426-455.wav|<breath> some shows okay <disfl.um> so i saw the lion king for my 18th birthday and i thought it was amazing it made me and my mum cry <disfl.um> <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_455-467.wav|<breath> i've also seen wicked and i think that was really cool <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_467-478.wav|<breath> i saw stomp when i was in school <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_478-493.wav|<breath> yeah i don't really like traditional musicals but i thought those were really good <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_493-514.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> yeah and i go and see loads of bands playing in london i'm going to see the libertines tomorrow <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_514-523.wav|<breath> in brixton so that would be cool <disfl.um> <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_523-536.wav|<breath> yeah and like loads of stuff in camden i often go to <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_536-550.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> it's really difficult i've run out of things to say now <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_54-68.wav|<breath> because i only get a loan that doesn't even cover my course fees <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_550-552.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_552-560.wav|<breath> plot of one of the musicals okay <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_560-570.wav|<breath> the lion king yeah so it's <disfl.um> <breath> about <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_570-590.wav|<breath> a baby lion and he's the son of <breath> the king kind of in lion terms of the tribe <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_590-594.wav|<breath> and <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_594-611.wav|<breath> it's about like his father dies the story and it's about him like growing up and <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_611-626.wav|<breath> learning his responsibilities and he falls in love <breath> with this little girl lion <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_626-643.wav|<breath> i <breath> can't remember her name i haven't watched the lion king in a long time <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_68-87.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah <breath> i don't know what more to say <disfl.uh> <disfl.um> i'll talk about my course <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_09_87-118.wav|<breath> so <breath> we have a very weird course structure where we're only in eight weeks of the year but when we're in we're in 930 to 530 monday to friday <breath>|41
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_0-10.wav|what brings you to london <disfl.um> i moved here to <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_10-21.wav|<breath> start an empress program at ucl <disfl.uh> i was previously <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_105-119.wav|<breath> like the program i like the relatively calmer pace of life compared to <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_119-140.wav|<breath> my situation in new york for sure i like that i'm not commuting 2 hours a day on the train <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_140-150.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i like the apartment better for sure <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_150-188.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> what are some things you do not like about i don't like that it rains every day <disfl.uh> a lot of days i also don't currently like the winter because it's dark out a lot <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_188-201.wav|<breath> i wish there was more sun and more hours in the daylight <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_201-204.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> yeah <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_204-226.wav|<breath> do <breath> <disfl.uh> you have a favorite restaurant and cuisine so i love mexican food i also love <disfl.uh> vietnamese food <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_21-52.wav|<breath> in new york so that was <breath> kind of a tough decision to leave the united states but i did want to get out of the united states for sure <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_226-251.wav|<breath> so they have chipotle here that's like my favorite restaurant in the states but it's a little different it's not worse or better but <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_251-299.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> it's different i've gotten it a few times but i've been trying to eat more well i need to save money because i don't have as much so i've been eating more at home cooking meals i do feel like some of the food here is <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_299-331.wav|<breath> better <disfl.uh> quality though compared to maybe the preservatives they put in a lot of food in the states i don't know maybe that's the thing here i just noticed that <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_331-346.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but interestingly i've had only vietnamese <disfl.ah> one time since i've moved here <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_346-370.wav|<breath> and i would get it like multiple times a week in new york <breath> <disfl.um> well i think it's interesting because there's a <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_370-385.wav|<breath> vietnamese place right across the street from me i still have not been there <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_385-390.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> okay next question <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_390-405.wav|<breath> have you been to any of the parks i just went to hyde park <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_405-415.wav|<breath> this past weekend which was very very nice <disfl.um> <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_415-431.wav|<breath> i really like me and my fiance went and she loves nature and the animals <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_431-449.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> it was very nice seeing like going by the pond i really like that part <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_449-462.wav|<breath> and seeing all the geese and the swans is the huge swan <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_462-481.wav|<breath> and how they're just not really afraid of humans here it's a nice symbiotic relationship they have where <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_481-493.wav|<breath> they get fed can it's approach humans and take pictures and <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_493-508.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> really cool but <disfl.uh> as far as the park i've been to <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_508-519.wav|<breath> that park i've been to one other park i <disfl.um> <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_519-541.wav|<breath> can't remember the name this is just generally i need to do more exploring of the city though i feel like <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_52-71.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> m but i could have stayed i guess in new york my job for one more year <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_541-576.wav|<breath> during the semester i focused a lot on work and now i've been off and i've had somewhat of a break and i haven't really done exploring i don't know when i will but <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_576-585.wav|<breath> i should be taking more advantage of that <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_585-595.wav|<breath> if <disfl.um> you met someone new to the city <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_595-606.wav|<breath> what would you recommend they go to see or do <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_606-620.wav|<breath> i probably wouldn't be the best tour guide at this point i <disfl.um> <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_620-633.wav|<breath> would just say i really like the area around piccadilly circus <disfl.uh> <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_633-658.wav|<breath> it's probably pretty touristy but you could even just walk around there for a few hours there's a lot to see lot to do <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_658-674.wav|<breath> depending whatever food you like you <disfl.um> <breath> can definitely find it in that area <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_71-94.wav|<breath> maybe <breath> see where that led <breath> but <disfl.uh> that's what brings me here so i guess exploration but also mainly school <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_11_94-105.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> what are some things i like about london i <breath>|43
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_0-16.wav|<disfl.uh> so i moved to london to start a master's degree at university <disfl.uh> college london <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_115-138.wav|<breath> still with university college london <breath> as a research assistant which i am still doing now my contract runs out in september <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_138-151.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and it's been enjoyable so far i'm working with eeg <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_151-163.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i feel like i could probably leave it about <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_16-31.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> that was <breath> two years ago i think <breath> maybe a little less <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_163-165.wav|<breath> <breath> <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_165-185.wav|<breath> so i like <disfl.um> <breath> there <disfl.um> <disfl.ah> lot there's of a good music in london there are some <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_185-208.wav|<breath> jazz bands that are active at the moment that i've <breath> seen a <breath> bunch of and i'm always learning new ones <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_208-234.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i don't know in the course of seeing new bands and hearing about people that are playing with certain groups that also have <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_234-245.wav|<breath> projects of their own <breath> <disfl.um> i've been to some <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_245-265.wav|<breath> jazz jams that i've really enjoyed and seen players there and gotten to know people that i really enjoy <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_265-282.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> there's some good ones in hackney <breath> <breath> they used to be one where i <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_282-299.wav|<breath> very close to where i used to live in archway <breath> <disfl.um> there's a really good <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_299-313.wav|<breath> night <breath> down in like portobello road which is quite a good one <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_31-42.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i studied cognitive neuroscience at the icn which is <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_313-339.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> there's probably some really good things in the south but i don't really know about it because i never go to south london <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_339-346.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> london <breath> <disfl.uh> what else <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_346-366.wav|<breath> <disfl.ah> gracious <breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> i like about london i suppose i've got a lot of friends in london <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_366-396.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> because <breath> i come from the isle of wight which is hideously boring if you're over the age of about four and you've got an iq above 20 <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_396-417.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so a lot of my friends from the isle of wight have either moved here or they've moved to <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_417-428.wav|<breath> similar cities in the south of the uk <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_42-56.wav|<breath> by russell square <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i really enjoyed the course it was <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_428-448.wav|<breath> i've also got some friends from university that <breath> came to the uk for university and then stayed here <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_448-481.wav|<breath> and now live in london as well so it's quite fun <breath> going and seeing them one of them is a dj so i've gone to see him play a few times <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_481-499.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> another one <breath> i didn't see for a long time and he was married but then <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_499-527.wav|<breath> they're getting a divorce but he moved back to london for a while so i kept in touch with him for a bit and now he's been <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_527-552.wav|<breath> sent off to glasgow through his work so i only see him very rarely i'm going to see him very soon at new years <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_552-569.wav|<breath> so that'll be quite nice <disfl.um> <breath> i'll leave it on there <breath> i <breath> <disfl.uh> <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_56-65.wav|<breath> about a year it was a year <disfl.um> <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_569-577.wav|<breath> really don't like <breath> i suppose yeah <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_577-592.wav|<breath> the <breath> transport in london the fact that it takes ages to get places <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_592-600.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> i kind of don't like <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_600-610.wav|<breath> the mentality of <breath> a lot of i think <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_610-631.wav|<breath> people that are native to the uk that have moved to london and kind of fallen in love with it <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_631-649.wav|<breath> and they don't quite realize or remember what it was like <breath> being in their hometown where <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_649-670.wav|<breath> they didn't hear about london all the time so you get this kind of strange mindset where people think that <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_65-92.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> <breath> i didn't like being poor because i didn't have any income which wasn't great and which kind of makes living in london quite difficult <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_670-683.wav|<breath> everything's <breath> fine and there's so much going on without realizing how <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_683-700.wav|<breath> bad certain parts of the uk can be or how badly they're doing compared to london <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_700-711.wav|<breath> and it's a really weird kind of cognitive dissonance which <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_711-724.wav|<breath> it's something interesting that i don't really <breath> feel like i've heard <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_724-755.wav|<breath> a lot of my friends talk about i always find it quite strange that <breath> they'd just kind of seem to forget everything outside of london now that they're here <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_755-758.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> i <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_758-759.wav|<breath> <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_759-773.wav|<breath> guess <disfl.uh> recently i've really <breath> eaten a lot of noodles it seems <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_12_92-115.wav|<breath> but <disfl.uh> i did manage to get through the year <breath> since then i've stayed in london i actually got a job <breath>|44
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_0-18.wav|okay so what brings me to london well <disfl.uh> i've lived here for pretty much all my life <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_110-126.wav|<breath> i think also coming from an asian community there's a bit more of like a <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_126-141.wav|<breath> japanese scene in london <disfl.um> so you have a bit more things to do <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_141-149.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> with your japanese friends in london <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_149-158.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> what else do i like about london <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_158-164.wav|<breath> i like that there are <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_164-176.wav|<breath> many people <breath> i think i feel most comfortable when there's <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_176-183.wav|<breath> loads of people about <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_18-36.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> i was born in japan but i came here when i was four years old so <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_183-199.wav|<breath> for example when you're just walking through soho or things like that in the evening <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_199-217.wav|<breath> you see loads of people having fun there's logging around you a lot of lights and stuff <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_217-230.wav|<breath> yeah it's different from oxford for example doing the same in oxford <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_230-240.wav|<breath> just feels a bit smaller <breath> you don't feel <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_240-251.wav|<breath> as part of a big crowd or a big place <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_251-255.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_255-265.wav|<breath> things i don't like about london <breath> that <disfl.um> <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_265-283.wav|<breath> <breath> is actually very hard to think about things i didn't like about london at the moment <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_283-289.wav|<breath> i guess things are expensive <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_289-299.wav|<breath> i mean that's a pretty bad thing i guess <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_299-308.wav|<breath> and other things it's far from <disfl.uh> my <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_308-321.wav|<breath> home country which is japan it's expensive to go to japan and <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_321-333.wav|<breath> <breath> <disfl.uh> it takes a long time there's like a big <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_333-347.wav|<breath> time <disfl.uh> lag <breath> so it's hard to call family and so on <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_347-368.wav|<breath> but generally yeah i've been to a few places and i don't know if it's just because it's home but <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_36-56.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah i don't know what brought me to london but i've been here all my life and <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_368-379.wav|<breath> there's not too many things i don't like about london <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_379-387.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah <breath> do i have <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_387-395.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> so my favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_395-413.wav|<breath> favorite restaurant don't is a difficult question i like being asked what is my favorite of anything <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_413-418.wav|<breath> same about cuisine but <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_418-434.wav|<breath> just to answer your question i'll give you a nice restaurant that i know of <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_434-452.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and that is one called ginz in chinatown they do a really good hot pot <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_452-477.wav|<breath> m hot pot is a great place to go with your friends it can be just one person that can be like ten people <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_477-492.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> you can eat what you want to at the pace that you want <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_492-511.wav|<breath> and <breath> if you're feeling really up for a good time you can go for karaoke as well <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_511-532.wav|<breath> they have like <breath> private rooms and <breath> places where you can go and chill and sing with your friends <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_532-540.wav|<breath> <breath> favorite cuisine recently i've been enjoying <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_540-550.wav|<breath> thai i guess <breath> which is a little bit <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_550-563.wav|<breath> strange because i'm also trying to go on a <breath> spiceless diet <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_56-75.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> london is great i've i'm a i'm a big city boy i guess i've tried living <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_563-568.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> yeah but <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_568-589.wav|<breath> maybe it's a bit of a guilty pleasure it's always fun to have a lot of spice in your food <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_589-613.wav|<breath> my favorite park <breath> i think must be hyde park i guess i live near there so i have a strong bias but <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_613-628.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> one of the nice things about hyde park is that the run <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_75-97.wav|<breath> well i mean i had to live <disfl.uh> in a smaller <breath> city <disfl.uh> oxford for my undergrad and that was <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_13_97-110.wav|<breath> a bit boring because there's not too much to do <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|45
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_0-21.wav|so the great pyramid of geez a bit made me think about churches and how much i hate going in them <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_123-138.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i've never quite forgiven churches and i even hate the smell of them <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_138-150.wav|<breath> when i <breath> read about william herschel i thought we always <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_150-161.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> concentrate on what people did that worked <breath> <disfl.um> <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_161-180.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> similarly with newton we concentrate on what he got right but he was also a nutcase and <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_180-198.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> he worked on alchemy and tried to turn lead into gold but herschel's bit nuttery of <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_198-226.wav|<breath> was that he actually believed that there were people who were living on the moon and he held quite strongly for a long period of his life <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_21-38.wav|<breath> and when i read here that people might have been even paid for building the pyramid <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_226-261.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> to the belief that he had seen evidence <breath> of structures like trees and i can't remember if there were buildings but other things <disfl.uh> on the moon that proved that there were <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_261-268.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> people people who lived there <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_268-290.wav|<breath> same is true for linus pauling who won i think he won two nobel prizes one for chemistry and one for <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_290-305.wav|<breath> one for biology he was in a race with watson and crick for dna <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_305-328.wav|<breath> but he in later life had this mad notion <breath> that if you took lords and lords and lords of vitamin c <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_328-339.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> it would obey cancer <breath> and <breath> because i <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_339-365.wav|<breath> like to try things out i did that at one time and all it does is make you go to the bathroom an awful lot <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_365-402.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> the north wind and the sun <disfl.uh> made me think of something that i've piece <disfl.uh> of music that i've been writing which is actually called the north wind and i wrote it for <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_38-69.wav|<breath> i thought fuck that when you go in churches all you know is that people were forced to build them and that we're supposed to like them and that they're <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_402-413.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> the impending death of one of my friend's grandmothers <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_413-424.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> that's what that made me <disfl.uh> think of and <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_424-433.wav|<breath> the poetry made me think of neuroscience <disfl.um> <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_433-458.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and a project i want to get one of my undergraduates to do which is i can't remember the lab it came from <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_458-491.wav|<breath> but there's a great paper showing how language or different words are mapped in different <disfl.uh> in <disfl.um> semantic structures in the brain and i have a hypothesis that if you take <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_491-510.wav|<breath> a top 100 of shakespeare's metaphors <breath> and almost anybody else's because he's ruined it for everybody else <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_510-521.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> that the distance in these maps between <breath> shakespeare's <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_521-546.wav|<breath> metaphorical images the things that he uses and other peoples will be greater and that one of the things that makes him so great <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_546-562.wav|<breath> is that he does actually stretch things across the he makes us travel greater distances <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_562-592.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <disfl.uh> in our brain <breath> the other thing that m the porn made me think of is about going to bed by day because i'm an habitual napper <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_592-629.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> this morning i had to meet a friend for breakfast at 10 00 <breath> she lives an hour away i live ten minutes away and i was 15 minutes late for a 10 00 breakfast <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_629-646.wav|<breath> because i really can't do mornings <breath> and <disfl.uh> i do go to bed every day <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_646-663.wav|<breath> even if i come into the icm i'll go home for a nap in the afternoon <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_663-675.wav|<breath> and in my office i used to have a bed and <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_675-692.wav|<breath> i removed it because too many people in the icm were taking naps in my office <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_69-98.wav|<breath> emblems of the most corrupt organization in the world ever and i even hate the smell of them because when i was young i was taught by nuns <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_692-702.wav|<breath> and it began to smell <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_702-721.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> the second poem <disfl.uh> didn't <disfl.um> make me think of anything at all actually so <disfl.um> i <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_721-743.wav|<breath> have nothing to say about that one <breath> counting from one to 40 strangely made me think about brian butterworth because <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_743-763.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> he works on numerical cognition and <breath> <disfl.uh> he was one of the people who got me to <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_763-785.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> be interested in how the brain processes <disfl.uh> numbers so that was what one to 40 made me think of <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_15_98-123.wav|<breath> and forced to go to church every sunday and even serve on the altar at 07 00 in the morning one week a month <breath>|47
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_0-14.wav|<disfl.um> <breath> so i'm going to talk about my favorite subject which is london <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_101-128.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and it's one of the only ones that are hope open between christmas and new year and a <disfl.um> they have great drag show there <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_128-154.wav|<breath> so we normally go there and then we go to the waffles shop after in <disfl.uh> near old compton street and have waffles and stuff <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_14-31.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i was born in london in london bridge <disfl.um> so i'm one of the few <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_154-179.wav|<breath> but <disfl.um> i've lived in london my whole life and it's my favorite place in the world <disfl.uh> even though i'm a bit biased <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_179-195.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> one of the things i love about it is even during this time of <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_195-205.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> populism and right wing we're still kind of <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_205-220.wav|<breath> liberal and we celebrate difference and we celebrate different cultures and foods and music <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_220-245.wav|<breath> and people and places and stuff like that and <breath> that's one of the reasons why i'm so proud of <disfl.uh> being from london <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_245-254.wav|<breath> my family have lived in the same area <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_254-275.wav|<breath> for about 300 years <breath> we can trace back <breath> <disfl.um> and unfortunately i'm the last person of my family <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_275-305.wav|<breath> to live <disfl.uh> in the era so <breath> <disfl.um> unless i have children that would be our family name that's dead in <disfl.um> that area she's quite sad but <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_305-323.wav|<breath> i live in the bermans era of london which was when i was a kid it was <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_31-86.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> real londoners <disfl.um> and you'll notice this at christmas when <disfl.uh> london's empty because everybody goes back to the surrey or wherever they're from and <disfl.uh> they leave london to the real londoner so it's the best time to go out drinking or go to a restaurant and stuff because there's no one around|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_323-346.wav|<breath> still quite <breath> <disfl.uh> post industrial <breath> there was empty factories and it was kind of run down there wasn't much development <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_346-358.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> and it was kind of dark and run down but <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_358-379.wav|<breath> in some ways <disfl.uh> i and <breath> missed that it's quite interesting that we're nostalgic about the things that were <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_379-395.wav|<breath> quite bad for us <breath> <disfl.um> a it's changed quite lot in the recent times <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_395-422.wav|<breath> there's new buildings and <breath> coffee shops and new people but it's hard to not feel or that it's lost its soul in some <disfl.uh> way <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_422-436.wav|<breath> and <disfl.um> i think it's a double edged sword i like that there's <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_436-453.wav|<breath> new developments but <breath> <disfl.um> i just wish that they would leave some of the stuff <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_453-471.wav|<breath> for the people that live around there the lawn dress and the pubs and stuff like that <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_471-486.wav|<breath> were the social places of the area that <breath> kind of disappearing <disfl.ah> now <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_486-522.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> i've lived in lots of places all over the world but i've always kept my flat in london so that i can come home whenever i want lived in new york for a bit <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_522-542.wav|<breath> which was kind of like london on the steroids but super neurotic city people shouting at each other lived <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_542-562.wav|<breath> <disfl.uh> in sydney for a bit melbourne south africa south america lived in africa for little bits of time <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_562-572.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> but there's no place like london <disfl.um> <breath> <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_572-605.wav|<breath> so i'd like to stay at you still if i can when i finish phd my because <disfl.uh> i don't really want to move away <disfl.um> seems to be a common problem <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_605-637.wav|<breath> in academia is that there's fewer and fewer jobs <breath> <disfl.uh> as sort of the academics work well into their eighty s and stuff and for the young people coming up <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_637-685.wav|<breath> there's less and less jobs in research and especially <disfl.um> jobs in london and academics are forced to move all over the world to get work so i'm <disfl.uh> not really sure what the solution is but going i'm to try my best to stay in london <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_685-691.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> <breath> for that <disfl.uh> <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_691-700.wav|<breath> the icm has got lots of interesting people <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_700-710.wav|<breath> doing <disfl.um> interesting projects my own project is <disfl.um> <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_710-724.wav|<breath> about <disfl.uh> what happens to your sleep structure when you lose your vision <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_724-752.wav|<breath> <disfl.um> so there's <breath> different eye diseases affect different parts of the eye some diseases affect the image forming layers of the ire <disfl.uh> other diseases affect <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_752-781.wav|<breath> the retinal gangling layer which <disfl.um> <breath> is the resting place for these certain class of cells which tell the brain when it's daytime or when it's nighttime <breath>|48
data/INTERSPEECH_segmented/train_16_87-101.wav|<disfl.um> over christmas we normally go to <breath> a pub in cherry cross road <breath>|48
