so the great pyramid of geez a bit made me think about churches and how much i hate going in them <breath> and when i read here that people might have been even paid for building the pyramid <breath> i thought fuck that when you go in churches all you know is that people were forced to build them and that we're supposed to like them and that they're <breath> emblems of the most corrupt organization in the world ever and i even hate the smell of them because when i was young i was taught by nuns <breath> and forced to go to church every sunday and even serve on the altar at 07 00 in the morning one week a month <breath> <disfl.um> i've never quite forgiven churches and i even hate the smell of them <breath> when i <breath> read about william herschel i thought we always <breath> <disfl.um> concentrate on what people did that worked <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.uh> similarly with newton we concentrate on what he got right but he was also a nutcase and <breath> <disfl.um> he worked on alchemy and tried to turn lead into gold but herschel's bit nuttery of <breath> was that he actually believed that there were people who were living on the moon and he held quite strongly for a long period of his life <breath> <disfl.um> to the belief that he had seen evidence <breath> of structures like trees and i can't remember if there were buildings but other things <disfl.uh> on the moon that proved that there were <breath> <disfl.uh> people people who lived there <breath> same is true for linus pauling who won i think he won two nobel prizes one for chemistry and one for <breath> one for biology he was in a race with watson and crick for dna <breath> but he in later life had this mad notion <breath> that if you took lords and lords and lords of vitamin c <breath> <disfl.um> it would obey cancer <breath> and <breath> because i <breath> like to try things out i did that at one time and all it does is make you go to the bathroom an awful lot <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> the north wind and the sun <disfl.uh> made me think of something that i've piece <disfl.uh> of music that i've been writing which is actually called the north wind and i wrote it for <breath> <disfl.um> the impending death of one of my friend's grandmothers <breath> <disfl.um> that's what that made me <disfl.uh> think of and <breath> the poetry made me think of neuroscience <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.um> and a project i want to get one of my undergraduates to do which is i can't remember the lab it came from <breath> but there's a great paper showing how language or different words are mapped in different <disfl.uh> in <disfl.um> semantic structures in the brain and i have a hypothesis that if you take <breath> a top 100 of shakespeare's metaphors <breath> and almost anybody else's because he's ruined it for everybody else <breath> <disfl.um> that the distance in these maps between <breath> shakespeare's <breath> metaphorical images the things that he uses and other peoples will be greater and that one of the things that makes him so great <breath> is that he does actually stretch things across the he makes us travel greater distances <breath> <disfl.um> <disfl.uh> in our brain <breath> the other thing that m the porn made me think of is about going to bed by day because i'm an habitual napper <breath> <disfl.um> this morning i had to meet a friend for breakfast at 10 00 <breath> she lives an hour away i live ten minutes away and i was 15 minutes late for a 10 00 breakfast <breath> because i really can't do mornings <breath> and <disfl.uh> i do go to bed every day <breath> even if i come into the icm i'll go home for a nap in the afternoon <breath> and in my office i used to have a bed and <breath> i removed it because too many people in the icm were taking naps in my office <breath> and it began to smell <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> and <breath> <disfl.um> the second poem <disfl.uh> didn't <disfl.um> make me think of anything at all actually so <disfl.um> i <breath> have nothing to say about that one <breath> counting from one to 40 strangely made me think about brian butterworth because <breath> <disfl.um> he works on numerical cognition and <breath> <disfl.uh> he was one of the people who got me to <breath> <disfl.uh> be interested in how the brain processes <disfl.uh> numbers so that was what one to 40 made me think of <breath> and then i started to get nervous because i thought <disfl.oh> gosh <breath> <disfl.um> what if the next test is kind of harder and i have to count backwards in sevens and
