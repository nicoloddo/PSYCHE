so what brings you to london <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i came to london to go to university and study psychology and language sciences at ucl <breath> <disfl.um> but after about a term i realized this course wasn't really for me so actually i'm dropping out and i'm going to change course <breath> i'm hoping to study fine art at ucl again in september 2020 <breath> some of the things i like about london are <breath> <disfl.uh> how multicultured it is <breath> and <breath> how big it is <breath> and how busy it is all the time <breath> because i came from a very small town in wales called monmouth <breath> and it's very different from here <breath> some of the things i do not like about london is probably <breath> the pollution <breath> and how loud it is every night <breath> because <breath> i'm not used to that and i <breath> fall asleep very lightly and i wake up very easily <breath> and the accommodation is so hot that i have to open the window every night <breath> and every night without fail i hear ambulances and police sirens <breath> and it's just very sad <breath> <breath> favorite restaurant or cuisine <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> i would say my favorite <breath> cuisine is probably asian because it's very homely to me <breath> and my family always used to cook food from hong kong the <breath> favorite dish made from obergin i don't know the english translation but it tastes very very good <breath> even though it smells a bit funky favorite <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> restaurant at the moment <breath> i don't really have a favorite restaurant but i did hear that roti king <breath> near houston station is very good <breath> so i'll probably go visit that soon for some roti <breath> as well as for the atmosphere m <breath> <breath> i like japanese food but <breath> a lot of the more budget end sushi is not that great here <breath> which is kind of sad <breath> but i do enjoy making sushi with my flatmates <breath> <disfl.um> that's quite entertaining even if we can't roll it out properly most of the time <breath> and it doesn't always taste great because most of them are vegan and <breath> we can't put a fish in it or anything <breath> have i been to any of the parks in london do i have a favorite park <breath> m <breath> i went to hyde park <breath> with my course mate last term which is very fun <breath> we walked there from our accommodation which was probably about <breath> a <disfl.ah> 35 minutes to 40 minutes walk <breath> which is not that bad but it's quite some exercise and then we had to walk further into hyde park to get to surf <disfl.uh> the serpentine i <breath> think that's the lake there <breath> it was a really chill day because it was autumn and all the leaves were starting to come down and it was quite pretty <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> <disfl.oh> i heard that <disfl.uh> <breath> no wait yeah i went to winter wonderland which i know was in hyde park that was also very fun <breath> it was greater than i imagined and the food marketplace is very exciting and festive even though i do think that winters <breath> and christmas is quite overrated sometimes <breath> it was nice to go there with my friends and then my family <breath> for new years <breath> <breath> another m thing that <breath> i noted about the park in winter wonderland <breath> was that the rides were quite expensive which is very sad because i wanted to ride all of them <breath> but they were way too expensive and out of budget for me as a student <breath> <breath> <disfl.um> <breath> if you met someone new to the city what would you recommend they go see or do <breath> <disfl.um> i probably recommend
