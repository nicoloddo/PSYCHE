Um even though I <breath> sort of live in London I'm always more in the central part of London rather than the outskirts of it <breath> I find it more <breath> um like vibrant it's more fastpaced <breath> um there's a lot of things to do there's a lot of shops <breath> um there's a lot of places to go and little sort of <breath> offbeat sort of like back rows key little shops and stalls <breath> that you're unaware of um it was feels like you've sort of seen the whole of London But <breath> this is why I'd like to sort of keep coming back and <breath> having a look about <breath> um <breath> I like the different shops now the food shops that are starting to come up There's all different ones like uh <breath> um more street vendor ones more from <breath> say you got I don't know <breath> somewhere from Thailand or <breath> uh Spain But it's more of the ones that you <breath> wouldn't get over here that are starting to come up in little pop up sort of shops and stalls that are often really nice different foods that are very sort of <breath> um unheard of or you've seen them They're sort of not being put in the same mixture <breath> in the way that you sort of think <breath> um <breath> things that I don't really like <breath> about London although I do like it is the fast pace because although it is fast paced and it's good and everything's on the go go go sometimes you can get into this sort of <breath> bobberation like this or it's too much or it's too overcrowded <breath> um there's bumping in the road <breath> um London Transport gets too much especially when you've finished work you got to get on the tube <breath> So um yeah London Transport although it's good as well it serves its purpose but other times it can just be a bit of <breath> an annoyance until you get like a clear carriage or clear bus a <breath> and a clear lane for it to go down It's brilliant <breath> um <breath> there's loads of restaurants as well around in London <breath> um <breath> yeah there's different ones but I think I like <breath> um there's a place called like benny harner <breath> uh where the chef sort of comes to your table and cooks the food up in front of you I think that's really good It's different but um I think it's been around for a while but <breath> only got introduced to it myself not too long ago <breath> I like the new little donut stools and shops that are opening up that are starting to take over <breath> and the nice health shops that are sort of <breath> coming up that are sort of <breath> basically being the infinite now <breath> Everyone's trying to eat cleaner and live better So there's more shops that are appearing that are serving that <breath> So there's a place called Cross Towns <breath> um yeah they do These sort of donuts are quite huge in size <breath> um Very nice My favorite one is the cinnamon <breath> <breath> cinnamon um scroll So it's a doughnut but it's like a <breath> cinnamon sort of pastry sort of thing But it's like a combined one But <breath> yeah very nice <breath> And there's um <breath> loads of parks as well to <breath> um go about <breath> hyde parks are really good Sometimes They have <breath> like once a year big winter wonderland over there <breath> and it's really really big and covers it sort of the whole of that field they have over there available <breath> loads um of things to do loads of rides <breath> loads of stalls offering different quirky things loads of people It's um just a very vibrant sort of fun place to be nighttime um <breath> is better as well because it's got more <breath> of that sort of edge to it You see <breath> the lights you get more of the feel the entertainment feel from it But <breath> um <breath> I think you should when you come to London <breath> visit <breath> say <breath> camden They've got a nice camden market It's all got these sort of little quirky little back areas and little alleys and back sort of street shops and markets and whatnot Brick Lane is another one
