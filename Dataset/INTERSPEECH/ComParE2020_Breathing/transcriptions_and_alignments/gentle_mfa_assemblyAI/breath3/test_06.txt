I took a walk in St james's park <breath> I think that's a poem somehow which is rather rude which I'm not going to recite here <breath> but it's a ah restoration poem by the rochford I think <breath> And he went something in St james's park That's the first thing Jim St james's park is a very nice park I quite like going for a walk there <breath> It's got all the <breath> sights of London that you might want to see The buckingham Palace and the back of Downing Street and Horse Guards parade <breath> But if you walk off St james's park and you get to Green Park <breath> it's uh equally very nice It might seem rather boring because there's no flowers there It's all green hence its name <breath> And apparently the story goes that the mistress of some king or other and I'm going to say George the Fourth but I could be wrong <breath> lived across the park from <breath> St Jake Friday <breath> uh from Green Park Think she lived somewhere near the mall Not the mall what's that street called There's a street piccadilly street piccadilly something Anyway Near Green Park The station She lived there <breath> before the station was built <breath> And <breath> the old king used to cross over the park on his way to go and have his merry way with his mistress <breath> So the queen who was quite jealous of this <breath> she insisted that the park he walks through must not contain any blooms or flowers So she set a decree to make sure that he would always be remembered that the park he walks through on his way to his mistress <breath> would be devoid of color <breath> However I think it's quite a nice park So there we go <breath> Now walking further along I think you get to hyde Park which is ginormous even though ginormous is not an appropriate word I think <breath> But hyde Park is <breath> interesting If you want to go for a long walk or a cycle I'm not a big fan of it <breath> It's very often the park where people go to see things at speaker's Corner which used to be rather interesting back in the day when it was sort of very innocent <breath> and just some weird preacher But now people walk by thinking I wonder if this is going to be the next major terrorist <breath> Just two minutes <breath> five minutes <breath> Oh goodness gracious if I messed it up by stopping <breath> So if I continue along the park into hyde Park and I walk past there would be terrorists or crack or weird old people In fact you don't see them these days not as much as <breath> once upon a time you might have done <breath> And when you do there's often a big police pleasant presence So it's not a very pleasant place to spend a lot of time However if you're on roller blades it's grand to go <breath> scooting around the park that way <breath> <breath> Now I would say if my favorite park <breath> was in London it would probably be <breath> um the park next to my house It's not really a park it's more of a little graveyard <breath> um which might seem a bit more bid but it's very pretty <breath> and it has nice flowers in it and people often walk their dogs <breath> And I quite like a park with a lot of dogs <breath> I like dogs In fact I'm quite dog broodie I would have a dog myself if I could keep one in the flat <breath> <breath> If I walk further on to the next park nearby it's a bit crap so I don't go there very often <breath> Victoria park <breath> which I used to think was the biggest but isn't <breath> is another fine park <breath> It's one along the canal side So if you want to go a cycle and <breath> go along the Grand Union Canal and to Victoria Park and have an ice cream It's a grand day out <breath> in there I believe there's a little oriental garden in the middle of the pond which again is a nice little visit <breath> Going south of the river we could get to <breath> um Crystal Palace area <breath> And the Crystal Palace Park is pretty grand That's quite impressive Where it used to have um <breath> the old Crystal Palace where it gets its name <breath> which was the former site of the Grand Exhibition <breath> or where the Grand Exhibition was relocated to
