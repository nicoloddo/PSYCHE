What brings me to London Well I'm from London so I was already here <breath> but I came to central London to start studying at ucl <breath> because I was bored of my job and thought I should do something more useful So I came to ucl to study anthropology <breath> because I'm interested in people and culture and society <breath> And so <breath> also I like London so I wanted to stay so I decided to move further into London from the south <breath> um and I like London because there's lots of stuff going on It's very buzzing with culture and arts and music <breath> and <breath> it's very busy which I like um <breath> the only thing I don't like about it is that it's difficult to go anywhere with countryside um I'm very outdoorsy <breath> so I like to climb rock climbing but there's not really anything outdoors so that is a problem <breath> um I think that in the future I probably won't stay here because I think that <breath> it's only good when you're <breath> kind of younger um <breath> favorite restaurant or cuisine uh <breath> or is it available in London Well everything's available in London really cuisine wise <breath> I do quite like Japanese food and <breath> there's quite a lot of that It seems quite fashionable at the moment I remember when I was younger it was kind of harder to find a Japanese restaurant but <breath> there's a lot now so it's clearly very very popular um <breath> I like a good katsu curry <breath> Nice ramen <breath> pretty nice My favorite actually I do like a <breath> lot of different uh Asian foods <breath> but <breath> um yeah very tasty <breath> Have uh I been to any of the parks in London Yeah I often go to Hampshire heath or go for a run I live about 20 minutes walk from there in archway <breath> so I often go for a run around there or in the summer just chill there with friends do some slack lining which is where you balance on a <breath> kind of rubber elastic thingy It's good fun <breath> Also uh regents Park is very nice <breath> but a lot busier I <breath> um <breath> have a friend who lives near Richmond Park so sometimes I go down there see the deer Very nice <breath> um <breath> I think if I met someone near the city I would probably recommend that they <breath> go to East London <breath> have a little walk around hear the <breath> local accents and that everyone from other countries knows about cockney and all that So I guess it's quite interesting <breath> um <breath> I have a favorite cafe in bethnal Green which I would say is quite good to go to because it's very <breath> kind of classic East London um I'd also recommend they go to all the classic sites because it's probably more interesting to them than it is for me <breath> um <breath> I don't really know tourist tractions very well so I'd probably be a really bad guide <breath> uh but yeah I'd probably show them the parks as well as I said like hampton heathen <breath> and uh regents Park and that <breath> Also the canals are really nice um that'd be really cool for people to see <breath> um <breath> yeah I haven't really been to many of the tourist attractions I haven't been to London eye <breath> very expensive <breath> which is probably why haven't I been <breath> I went to the Tower of London not long ago my mum because I thought I should really see some of these attractions <breath> And it was quite cool <breath> A lot of lot of museums in there <breath> But expensive So expensive I mean <breath> yeah you have to be a certain type of tourist to enjoy London <breath> But um <breath> other tourist attractions like a lot of museums obviously British museums really near ucl so I've been there quite a few times <breath> um <breath> there was one museum that was really good that I would recommend to people but I can't remember the name of it but it's kind of like <breath> almost like a surgery museum <breath> And there's a lot of weird body parts in like jars It's really weird and uh <breath> quite edgy So I think a lot of people would be interested um <breath> but yeah overall I think yeah like a lot the of tourist attractions are probably too expensive and a little bit overrated because of that I think if it was cheaper
