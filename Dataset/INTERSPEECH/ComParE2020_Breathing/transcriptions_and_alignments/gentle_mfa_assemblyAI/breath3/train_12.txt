Uh so I moved to London to start a master's degree at University uh College London <breath> uh That was <breath> two years ago I think <breath> maybe a little less <breath> um I studied cognitive neuroscience at the icn which is <breath> by Russell Square <breath> um <breath> I really enjoyed the course It was <breath> about a year It <breath> was a year um <breath> uh <breath> I didn't like being poor because I didn't have any income which wasn't great <breath> and which kind of makes living in London quite difficult <breath> but uh I did manage to get through the year <breath> Since then I've stayed in London I actually got a job <breath> still with University College London <breath> as a research assistant which I am still doing now My contract runs out in September <breath> um <breath> and it's been enjoyable so far I'm working with eeg <breath> um <breath> I feel like I could probably leave it about <breath> <breath> <breath> so I like um <breath> there um ah lot there's of a good music in London There are some <breath> jazz bands that are active at the moment that I've <breath> seen a <breath> bunch of and I'm always learning new ones <breath> um <breath> I don't know in the course of seeing new bands and hearing about people that are playing with certain groups that also have <breath> projects of their own <breath> um <breath> I've been to some <breath> jazz jams that I've really enjoyed and seen <breath> players there and gotten to know people that I really enjoy <breath> um there's some good ones in hackney <breath> <breath> They used to be one where I <breath> very close to where I used to live in archway <breath> um there's a really good <breath> night <breath> down in like portobello Road which is quite a good one <breath> um <breath> there's probably some really good things in the south but I don't really know about it because I never go to South London <breath> um London <breath> uh what else <breath> ah gracious <breath> uh <breath> I like about London I suppose I've got a lot of friends in London <breath> uh because <breath> I come from the Isle of wight which is <breath> hideously boring if you're over the age of about four <breath> and you've got an iq above 20 <breath> um so a lot of my friends from the Isle of wight have either moved here or they've moved to <breath> similar cities in the south of the UK <breath> um <breath> I've also got some friends from university that <breath> came to the UK for university and then stayed here <breath> and now live in London as well So it's quite fun <breath> going and seeing them One of them is a DJ so I've gone to see him play a few times <breath> um another one <breath> I didn't see for a long time and he was married but then <breath> they're getting a divorce <breath> but he moved back to London for a while so I kept in touch with him for a bit and now he's been <breath> sent off to Glasgow through his work so I <breath> only see him very rarely I'm going to see him very soon at <breath> New Years <breath> so that'll be quite nice um <breath> I'll leave it on there <breath> I <breath> uh <breath> really don't like <breath> I suppose yeah <breath> The <breath> transport in London the fact that it takes ages to get places <breath> uh <breath> I kind of don't like <breath> the mentality of <breath> a lot of I think <breath> people that are native to the UK That have moved to London and kind of fallen in love with it <breath> and they don't quite realize or remember what it was like <breath> being in their hometown where <breath> they didn't hear about London all the time So you get this kind of strange mindset where people think that <breath> everything's <breath> fine and there's so much going on without realizing how <breath> bad certain parts of the UK Can be or how badly they're doing compared to London <breath> And it's a really weird kind of cognitive dissonance which <breath> it's something interesting that I don't really <breath> feel like I've heard <breath> a lot of my friends talk about I always find it quite strange that <breath> they'd just kind of seem to forget everything outside of London now that they're here <breath> uh I <breath> <breath> guess uh recently I've really eaten a lot of noodles it seems <breath> and there are tons of great places
