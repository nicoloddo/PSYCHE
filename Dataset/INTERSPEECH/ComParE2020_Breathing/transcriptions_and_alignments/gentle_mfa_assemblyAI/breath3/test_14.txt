M <breath> I came to London about six years ago to study <breath> I had finished my high school studies and I wanted to come to university <breath> So I did two years of what they call six form here <breath> in which I did math physics and economics <breath> After that I went to university in another part of London in another part of England <breath> And so I left London for a few years <breath> and then <breath> now I've come back <breath> to work and to finish up my studies <breath> One of the things the few things That I do like about London is The level of diversity that London brings <breath> London is a melting pot with people from different cultures from different countries <breath> and funny things Everything works here in London People get along with each other <breath> There's a sense of community and there's a sense of understanding even though <breath> people are probably not going to talk to you in the streets <breath> but if you need help <breath> <breath> there's a high chance that they will help you <breath> And <breath> I just really love that sense of spirit and that sense of understanding <breath> um and some of the things I Do not like about London is it Is just too expensive <breath> The city is so <breath> expensive It feels like every time I breathe there's money coming out of my pocket going on an account <breath> It is not the best <breath> um another thing that I do not Like about London is when traveling on The tube during peak times <breath> or rush hour <breath> it's just so full people have barely time <breath> people can barely breathe <breath> um but then again it ties back to the understanding that everyone understands that this is what you have to go through <breath> to live <breath> in this wonderful city <breath> <breath> So one of my favorite restaurants in London would have to be benihana <breath> um they have three locations in St paul's piccadilly and in Chelsea <breath> I love benihana because it's Japanese food and I absolutely love Japanese food <breath> The seasoning the fresh fish the sushi the beef the teriyaki sauce <breath> is just absolutely amazing It's everything I could eat it every day <breath> but obviously it's too expensive so I can't <breath> And <breath> when it comes to parks in London I haven't been to that many parks in London I've been to hyde Park <breath> And I've been to regents Park <breath> And these are really nice parks During the summer you can sit down and have a meal <breath> or just look at the view and just take it all in <breath> So it's a really great experience um between the two <breath> I think I would probably go for hyde Park <breath> just because you can get to harrods <breath> quite <breath> fast I think you get to Harris from regent Park as well <breath> um yeah I've never done it but I think you should be able to because they're quite close to each other <breath> um so if someone you came to London and had to recommend <breath> somewhere um for them to <breath> go wow I would probably recommend <breath> the tourist attractions such as um buckingham palace <breath> and Big Ben obviously hyde Park <breath> um just for them to be London eye the shard <breath> just for them to kind of see London from a tourist perspective and to experience <breath> the culture that <breath> London has to offer I'd also take some to you know some of the <breath> not so touristy parts but parts that have such great street food <breath> such as an area shortage <breath> hackney Or I should have a canary wolf as well because that's really really nice It's like the business district <breath> of London where all the big <breath> some of the big corporations and some of the big banks are located <breath> And <breath> I haven't been to that many notorious attractions myself <breath> in London just because I don't know I feel like when you live here you always have this thing at the back of your head that I could always go So I bother go today <breath> but I haven't been to any but
