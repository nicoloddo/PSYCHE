Um so I've come to London uh for multiple reasons <breath> Firstly I got married in September and my now husband works <breath> uh in here London so I moved here to join him here <breath> um but also I got a job um here at ucl <breath> um to postdoc work as a um which was lucky <breath> given my husband was here so that was good <breath> um <breath> london is quite different I was in Oxford before which <breath> um is a m much smaller city and <breath> I find London quite um busy and quite overwhelming um but we live quite far out um for Michael winchmore Hill which <breath> I've heard described as <breath> um <breath> just <breath> really not very <breath> like London <breath> um given it is in London it's very quiet and feels quite suburban and we have a village green and <breath> it's quite nice So um <breath> I actually like being able to escape the center and <breath> travel back out to the quiet suburbs that come in for work um and have the option to come in and <breath> um have all the attractions of London close by but um <breath> not too close um we did think about moving further in so that my commute would be better <breath> but we decided we just liked it um further out where it was a bit quieter <breath> and like to me it isn't too bad um <breath> it's 35 minutes door to door which is <breath> pretty good for London so um I feel like we kind of have the best of both worlds in that way <breath> um but there are there are lots of things I like about London too There are a lot of concerts here um <breath> which is nice We didn't have so many back in Oxford so it's cool to get to see <breath> bands I like much uh more easily <breath> um and the food as well um <breath> me and my husband quite like going to restaurants particularly he likes quite posh places so <breath> when his uh mum comes to visit we quite often go somewhere nice in London <breath> because she really likes her good food too <breath> um so yeah we've been to quite a range of different places <breath> um around where we are there's a lot of Italian restaurants not quite sure why I think there's quite a <breath> big Italian community um <breath> which is probably my favorite type of food so that's quite nice <breath> um so <breath> yeah we enjoy going out for food quite a lot <breath> um and the parks in London are <breath> cool too um we have quite a few round <breath> where we are but I like the fact that even in the center <breath> you have these quite big um open spaces that you can go to <breath> um <breath> I really like hyde Park for example that's really nice but <breath> most of them are pretty nice <breath> um <breath> so I definitely recommend those to people coming <breath> to London for the first time I think the parks are one of the best things about London <breath> um <breath> there's all sorts something I would probably <breath> recommend if someone was new to the city <breath> um would be something called the Wallace Collection which is <breath> kind of like this old house where six centric old man used to live I think maybe he was an architect or <breath> something but he collected a lot of different things a lot of <breath> random bizarre things And they're all in this house <breath> um and it's just a really interesting collection of objects and <breath> old bits of old buildings kind of all thrown in together and that was quite cool um I'm not sure many people know about that So that's probably what I would <breath> recommend to someone uh to go to if they <breath> were new to London um <breath> but I haven't really been to many of the other sort of big tourist attractions like the London I <breath> um <breath> don't know <breath> I think they're just often so busy <breath> um and full of people that I tend to steer clear <breath> um <breath> probably more I've been to <breath> tourist attractions in terms of shopping
