What brings me to London is that I live here and I've lived here for about 25 years <breath> I work here and I've lived in North London in the same place for about ten years <breath> Things I like about London are the multiculturalism the vast expanse of buildings and parks <breath> and also the fact that it has a great historical and architectural rich environment in which you can walk around <breath> free of charge and see the many great buildings <breath> that are here <breath> Some things I don't like about London uh are the fact that it's so overcrowded Seems that everywhere you go there are people every time of the day 24 hours seven days a week <breath> Sometimes You just can't escape <breath> the fact that there are so many people around <breath> There's a lot of traffic in London and a lot of people using public transport <breath> You feel like you're fighting for space all the time <breath> I do have a favorite restaurant and it serves English cuisine But the inside of the restaurant is decorated in old church furniture <breath> It's based in kilburn in North London <breath> and you may be sitting on an <breath> old pew from a church while you're eating <breath> um being served wine from a chalice Or you may be sitting staring at a pulpit with no minister in it <breath> The food is very good and it's not very expensive <breath> It's always quite a busy place <breath> I have been to all the parks in London but I think my favorite park is hyde Park <breath> I like the fact that it has a lake <breath> and you can actually take a boat onto the lake and roll around in the summertime <breath> It also has a really nice cafe called the serpentine <breath> which is on the edge of the lake and you can sit outside all times of year have a coffee <breath> and watch the swans on the ducks gliding past <breath> It's always uh popular with tourists <breath> And hyde Park is one of the royal parks in London of which there are five <breath> But I particularly like it because it's right bang in the center <breath> but you also feel like you're not in London when you're walking around it <breath> It has got a <breath> very interesting Italian garden <breath> on the north side near <breath> gloucester uh place <breath> um which was designed in the early 19th century <breath> It has a pagoda and some fountains <breath> which make it a really nice place to chill out <breath> Some of the other places in hyde Park which are quite interesting are the Peter Pan statue and also speaker's Corner where <breath> an ancient law allows people to stand up <breath> and say things even which are offensive nowadays <breath> but without getting arrested So it has the only place in London left where you have freedom of speech <breath> and you can discuss any subject <breath> you want without being arrested <breath> If I met someone new in the city what would I recommend they go and see <breath> I think probably my favorite landmark in London is Tower Bridge <breath> I'm always in awe of the size of its structure <breath> and the fact that it is a bridge that actually opens up <breath> uh to allow boats and ships to go through the center of it <breath> I've often marveled at the engineering and the fact that it was 250 built over years ago <breath> shows uh that the people that were around then are obviously very intelligent <breath> and they built something that really has lasted the test of time <breath> um the area around Tower Bridge is also very interesting because it used to be <breath> the old docks of London where all the ships the spices came in from <breath> the West India Trading Company <breath> Some uh of the buildings you can still smell the spices
