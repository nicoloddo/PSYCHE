what brings me to london well i'm from london so i was already here but i came to central london to start study in uh uh ecl because i was bored of my job and for i should do something uh uh more useful so i came to uh ecl to study anthropology because i am interested in people and culture uh and society and so uh uh oh also i like london somewhere to stay so i decided to move further into london from the south and i like uh uh london because there's lots of stuff going on it's very buzzing with uh culture and arts uh and music and it's very busy which i like um the only thing i don't like about it is that it's uh difficult to go anywhere with countryside um i'm very uh outdoorsy so i like to climb or climbing but there's not really anything outdoors so that is a problem um i think that in the future i probably won't stay here because i think that it's only uh good when you're kind of younger uh um favorite restaurant or cuisine err or is it available in uh london well everything's available in london really cuisine wise i'd do quite like japanese food and there's quite a lot of that seems quite fashionable at the moment i remember a nice younger that was kind of harder to find a japanese restaurant but there's a lot now so it's clearly very very popular erm are you like a good cats you curry nice rarm and pretty um um uh nice though from a um favour actually i do like a lot of a different asian foods erm but yeah very tasty er uh if i'd been to any of the parks in london yeah i often go to hampson he forgot for a run i live about twenty minutes walk from there in arch way so i often go for run round there uh or in the summer just chill there friends do some slack lining which the way you balance on a kind of robber elastic thingy good fun uh also regions parks very nice but a lot busier erm um have a friend who lives in the richmond parks or sometimes i go down there see the dear very nice um i think if if i met someone near the city i would probably recommend they go to east london have a uh little walk around here the the local accents and that uh everyone from other countries knows about cocknean or that so i guess it's quite interesting erm i have a uh favorite cafe in bethan of green which i would say is quite good to go to cause it's very kind of classic east london um i'd also recommend the go to like all the classic sites cause it's probably more interesting to them than i than is for me uh um i uh don't really know tourist tracks is very well so probably be issued a uh really bad guide er but yeah i'd probably show them the parks as well as i said like hamster heathen and uh regents park and that uh also the canals are really nice erm that'd be really cool for people to see uh um yeah i haven't really been to many tourists tractions i haven't uh been filled on an eye very expensive it is probably why i haven't been uh went to the tower of london not long ago my mum as i thought i should really see some of these attractions and it was quite cool a lot of lot of museums and there but expensive so uh expensive i mean yeah you have to be a certain type of tourist to enjoy london but other uh um tourist tractions like a lot of museums obviously british museums really near ecl so i've been there quite a few times um there's one museum that was really good that i would recommend to people but i can't remember the name of it but it's kind of like a almost like a uh uh surgery museum and there's a lot of like kind of weird body parts in
