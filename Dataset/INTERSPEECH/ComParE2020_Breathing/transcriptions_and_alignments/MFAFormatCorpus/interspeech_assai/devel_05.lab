I came to London to, um, study at ucl. I came to London from New York. I came to London to study philosophy. In particular, I'm studying for my mphil. M at ucl. um, part of why I came to London also is the city itself. um, it's a very interesting big city and coming from New York, I wanted to live in another city that was interesting to me and had a lot of culture, a lot of museums, a lot of music going on, um, art scenes. So I came for school first, but beyond that, the ability to live a life that I found interesting, um, I like about London, um, the fact that there is a lot going on. I like the amount of parks there are actually is one of my favorite things. um, living in New York, there's really only two big parks. Well there are a few big parks, but the two biggest parks that I would frequent were Central Park and Prospect Park. Outside of that, you just have very tiny parks, some, um, the size of a parking lot. So what I like about one is I live close to hampstead heath, I live close to regent's Park as well, and I can frequent those massive parks very easily. Beyond that, there's a lot of other parks too, though, even just in the north, we have Victoria Park, we have others as well. um, so I like being outside in London. I like exploring, I like taking pictures in the parks, going to concerts, going to shows, going to museums. um, what do I dislike about London? I dislike the weather sometimes. um, it rains a lot in London, as you might know. um so I dislike the idea that I wake up and it's raining and I go to bed and it's raining, and sometimes it's very gloomy. And that can be a little bit depressing to not see the sun very often, which an issue the issue of not seeing the sun very often is exacerbated by there being very short days during the winter. Once it turns into daylight savings time. um, it's dark by 04:00 p.m., completely pitch black by 05:00 p.m.. At the latest, I'd say 04:30 p.m.. um, and when it's raining outside all day and I don't wake up often, I don't wake up till about 11:00 unless I have school. And really my closest, my earliest, uh, day is 11:00 p.m., so I'm only out of the house by ten, so it's only 5 hours. And then when you have class and you have work, the days go by very quickly and you don't see a lot of the sun. And I do miss that. So that's one thing I dislike about London. Do you have a favorite restaurant? mhm my favorite restaurant is not available in London. um, my favorite restaurant is actually my dad's restaurant. He owns an ah Italian restaurant in North Carolina. In the United States? um, and it's not available in London, obviously, but my favorite type of cuisine is certainly available in London. I have a few different I wouldn't say have one particular type of cuisine that's my favorite. um, well, I cook a lot, actually, so that's all available in London. I cook a lot with tofu. I cook a lot of vegetables. I really cook meat very much that is available in London. I just don't utilize it. But I do like to go to restaurants. I don't have a particularly favorite, though. I wouldn't say that there's any one that's my favorite. Have I been to any parks? Yes, I've been to a lot of parks in London. My favorite favorite park is my favorite two parks are regents and hampstead heath. um, I'd say that my favorite between those two is hampstead heath. It has a little bit more of acquaintance to it. regents, um, feels like it's too organized for me. um, regents Park. It's very nice.
