uh so i come from singapore and i came over to london to pursue my undergraduate uh studies before up uh i've lived and uh even though i'm singapore and i've also lived in china and south korea and uh as well as before i came over to london um i studied psychology and anger signs and i'm ends currently in my thought yeah um so upon graduation i hope to pursue uh uh mse and developmental psychology either at uh ucl or at kings and i hope to be uh developmental or child psychologists so i really uh some of my hobbies include uh running uh as well as traveling uh i recently came back from um germany and japan i have some family in japan so i go to japan almost every year at uh least once a year i um the favorite um country that i've been to so far i would uh say or rather the favorite city that i like uh uh thus far i think it was to be like tokyo because i like how efficient it is i like how uh transport there is so much more convenient and i like how everything opens up to uh really late at night so i can still like get fruit uh read a hang out my friends really late um yeah uh some of the other countries that i really enjoyed visiting includes greece marias uh um melbourne which i uh uh guess uh australia and indian uh bali in indonesia i think that's because i really like um the beach and i really like the c r i to uh go south body so that's why i guess i really like um countries with beaches and like um the sea side in general uh i hope to like stay in london for another two uh us and the potentially um move to canada or back to south carolina uh ones lived uh i want to let move to kind of good canada because i really like cold wind tests uh and i really like the snow and i just like being around natura so um that is one of my effect the big reasons why i want to move that uh i think london might get a bit too busy for me sometimes so and there's a uh lot of people so that's why i might not uh generally were one of the few in a long time um uh south korea uh uh so another option for me because i live there uh for really long and a lot of my friends at that so um uh and i think i'm also really used to the country so that's also another reason why uh i think i might want to move back to south korea after uh living in london uh but that said i really like london a lot i like how diversities uh i like how i can meet so many different people off uh uh coming from so many different backgrounds and i like how it's also uh really close to europe i think if i had
