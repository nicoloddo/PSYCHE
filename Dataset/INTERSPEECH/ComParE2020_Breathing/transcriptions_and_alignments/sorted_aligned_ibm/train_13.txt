okay so what brings me to london while uh i've lived here for pretty much all my life uh i was born in japan but i came here when i was four years old so yeah i don't know what uh brought me to london but i've been here all my life and london's great i've i'm a i'm a big city boy i guess i've tried living well i mean i had to live uh in a smaller cisy uh uh oxford for my undergrad and that was a bit boring because that's not too much to do um i think also coming from an asian community there's a uh uh bit more of like a like a japanese scene in london and um so you have a bit more things to do um with the uh japanese friends in london what else uh do i like about london i like that there are uh many people uh i think i feel most comfortable when there's there and there's loser people about um example like when you're just walking through so uh ho or things like that and the evening you see those are people having fun that's uh logging around june flights and stuff yeah it's different from oxford for example like yeah doing the same and oxford just feels a bit smaller you don't feel has part of like a a big crowd or a big place yeah things i don't like about london that it's actually uh very hard to think about things i don't like about london and i guess things are expensive um that's a pretty bad thing i guess and other things it's it's far from my uh from my home country which is japan it's like expensive to go to japan and uh uh uh yeah it takes a long um time that's like a big uh time lag uh so it's hard to call family and so on there but uh generally yeah i bent uh a few places and i don't know if it's just because it's home but there's not too many things i don't like about london um yeah do i have ah so my favorite restaurant uh uh uh cuisine favorite restaurant is difficult question i don't like being uh asked what is my favorite of anything yeah same about cuisine but just to answer your uh uh question i'll uh give you a nice restaurant that i know of um and that is one call gende uh in chinatown they do a really good hot pot help what's a great place to go with your friends that can be just one person that can be like ten people um you can eat what you want to at the pace that you want and if you're feeling you know really up for a good time you can get for karaoke as well they have like private rooms and yeah places where you can get insurance uh uh with your friends favorite cuisine recently i've been enjoying tie i guess which is a little bit strange because i'm also trying to go on a uh spiceless diet um yeah but maybe it's a bit of a guilty pleasure uh it's always one to have like a lot of spice in your feet the my favorite park i think must be height park i mean i guess i live near there so i have a strong bias but um the the nice thing or one of the nice things about
