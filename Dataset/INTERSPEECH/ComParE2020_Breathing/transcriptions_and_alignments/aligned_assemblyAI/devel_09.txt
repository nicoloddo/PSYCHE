I came to London um to do my undergrad degree Following uh finishing my A levels I started um a degree in biomedical Sciences It was a bsc At King's College London I um was at the guys campus for about a term and then I dropped out um and then the following week I submitted an application for University College London for archaeology uh that was a bachelor of Science um so I came to London in September studied um for three years during my undergrad degree Then I um took a year out um I worked full time at various cafes and then I started my masters in uh September um my favorite things about London are that it's always busy and there's always something to do um I am from a little village in the countryside in the middle of nowhere So moving to London was a big deal And it was sort of the complete opposite of where I grew up And I like how busy it is and there are so many options to do things I don't have to plan things too far in advance I can spontaneously go out to the market or go see a park or a museum or gallery um I studied archeology so I really like museums and I'm into art as well so I like the art galleries in London The ah tate Modern is my favorite Or the Victoria Annalbert Museum in South kensington um I like the Victoria and Albert Museum because there's a huge range of things to see lots of different materials um some things that I don't like about London are that it's really busy so I like it and I don't um it can be really stressful to just go and do things um simple things like going to the shops because of all the people um I also hate it when tourists walk really slow on the pavement That's one of the worst things about London um my favorite restaurant is uh hard to pick I have quite a few um one of my favorite restaurants to go to is flatiron um it's in Common Garden and it just does steak There's only one thing really on the menu um and then you choose your sides to go with it I've been quite a few times with my brother my boyfriend I took my family there um you get free popcorn at the start of the meal You also get free ice cream on your way out which I love um but the only thing I don't like about the restaurant is that there are always massive uh waiting times um I love the parks in London I live in camden so regents Park is really close As is primrose Hill I really like primrose Hill um especially for New Year's Eve I went the other week with my flatmates to watch the fireworks and do a countdown from the hill which was really fun um I also like hampstead heath I've been there quite a few times Also been there swimming in the ponds um my favorite park would have to be regents Park just because I've spent more time there than the others um if I met someone new to the city I would recommend that they go to the museums just because they're free and you get to see so much for no money um especially around Chicago Square There are quite a few to see
