What brings me to London is that I live here and I've lived here for about 25 years I work here and I've lived in North London in the same place for about ten years Things I like about London are the multiculturalism the vast expanse of buildings and parks and also the fact that it has a great historical and architectural rich environment in which you can walk around free of charge and see the many great buildings that are here Some things I don't like about London uh are the fact that it's so overcrowded Seems that everywhere you go there are people every time of the day 24 hours seven days a week Sometimes You just can't escape the fact that there are so many people around There's a lot of traffic in London and a lot of people using public transport You feel like you're fighting for space all the time I do have a favorite restaurant and it serves English cuisine But the inside of the restaurant is decorated in old church furniture It's based in kilburn in North London and you may be sitting on an old pew from a church while you're eating um being served wine from a chalice Or you may be sitting staring at a pulpit with no minister in it The food is very good and it's not very expensive It's always quite a busy place I have been to all the parks in London but I think my favorite park is hyde Park I like the fact that it has a lake and you can actually take a boat onto the lake and roll around in the summertime It also has a really nice cafe called the serpentine which is on the edge of the lake and you can sit outside all times of year have a coffee and watch the swans on the ducks gliding past It's always uh popular with tourists And hyde Park is one of the royal parks in London of which there are five But I particularly like it because it's right bang in the center but you also feel like you're not in London when you're walking around it It has got a very interesting Italian garden on the north side near gloucester uh place um which was designed in the early 19th century It has a pagoda and some fountains which make it a really nice place to chill out Some of the other places in hyde Park which are quite interesting are the Peter Pan statue and also speaker's Corner where an ancient law allows people to stand up and say things even which are offensive nowadays but without getting arrested So it has the only place in London left where you have freedom of speech and you can discuss any subject you want without being arrested If I met someone new in the city what would I recommend they go and see I think probably my favorite landmark in London is Tower Bridge I'm always in awe of the size of its structure and the fact that it is a bridge that actually opens up uh to allow boats and ships to go through the center of it I've often marveled at the engineering and the fact that it was built over 250 years ago shows uh that the people that were around then are obviously very intelligent and they built something that really has lasted the test of time um the area around Tower Bridge is also very interesting because it used to be the old docks of London where all the ships the spices came in from the West India Trading Company Some uh of the buildings you can still smell the spices
