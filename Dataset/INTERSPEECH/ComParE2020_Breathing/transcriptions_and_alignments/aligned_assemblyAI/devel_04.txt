Um so I moved to London for the first time in 2014 uh for my Masters degree I studied social policy and development at Dallasy um I was in London for a year but then afterwards moved to frankfurt with my partner um because he got a job there he's German We stayed in frankfurt for a year but then decided that it was a bit dull for us so we decided to move back to London um in 2016 and I've been in London since then um we quite like London It's an exciting city um we like how cosmopolitan it is how you can find things to do um at any time of day in any area um we like the range of cultures food ah cinema theater all of that um I think it's a really great city and have met a lot of interesting people from around the world However sometimes I find London a bit stressful um it feels a bit isolating and dirty Rent um is extremely high given how low the salaries are um but I still think it's a fun city to be in while you're young um particularly what I like about London is the diverse uh culture around cuisines that it has um the other day I went to an ethiopian restaurant which I quite liked um I haven't had ethiopian food elsewhere before um and in particular the cuisine that I think I like most is um Indian One of my favorite restaurants is dishum I um go there regularly with my partner and a friend of ours We meet there maybe once or twice a month for breakfast on the weekends And it's really nice because it's become part of our routine uh and a place to meet up with friends and um enjoy a nice meal um my favorite parks in London I would say are Victoria Park um and hackney Downs So I live in hackney and Stoke newington actually Cliffhold Park as well um and I think that's an important part of what we do and how we get away from the busy life of the city um I enjoy going to the parks and um just watching people play basketball or football lying down reading um taking a jog taking a nap um Victoria Park I quite like in the summer It's really full and bustling and really big so you can just meander about for a long time um hackney Downs is more local um so it feels like it's really part of the community crystalled park is really lovely as well It's very family oriented so you can find deer and birds and goats I guess and horses or whatever um which is also nice because it it also gives kind of a community feel um I haven't really done touristy stuff in London for quite a long time When um my partner and I moved back to London in 2016 we had a bunch of friends coming almost every weekend so we would take them to a lot of the tourist attractions london Eye South Bank tate Borough Market a lot of stuff around this side of the city this side of the river as well St um paul's shortage Brick lane We um almost had kind of a routine and we just walk around with our friends chat but also kind of lazily look around which is another nice thing about London is you can just ample about but your eye can still be interested in what you see architecturally um kind of the uh people the graffiti all of that I think it's really it's um really nice to walk around some um of the stuff I would say is a bit overrated but I guess that's because I've done it so many times that it's no longer novel to me
