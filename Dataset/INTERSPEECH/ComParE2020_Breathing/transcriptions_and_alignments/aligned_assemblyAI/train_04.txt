I came to London UM to go to school to go to University College London initially uh for the Masters program UM in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at ucl And I've stayed in London to continue UM in Cognitive neuroscience by doing a PhD uh program here at the icn UM on my second year now and I'll probably stay in London until I'm finished And there's a few things I like about London UM At first the things that I didn't like so much are now in ways things that I do like UM There'S a great deal available to You UM At great convenience UM there's anything you want any kind of food or whatever you need UM you don't have to get in a car and drive a half hour to get there everything's very close by that makes things convenient I like that UM there's a lot to do there's a lot to still explore There's tons of museums UM there's a lot of restaurants I like to go to a number of restaurants particularly UM I would say my favorite is probably franco monkas They have really good pizza And I have also explored a lot of different parks in London such as hyde Park and Russell uh Square Gardens and uh regents Park And there's tons of parks If I had to choose a favorite UM I really like hyde Park and I would maybe say that's my favorite in London At least there's a lot in the UK UM if someone was new to the city I would recommend that they see a number of different sites and things such as museums And UM those are always really interesting They're free UM some of it can be boring but you just got to explore around and figure out what interests you and what you like I really like the British uh library Going there for the first time is really cool They have uh artifact treasure room there that has all sorts of really interesting old objects books and literature and paintings UM and I would also probably recommend that someone new to London visit the UM British Library uh not the British Library The British UM Museum That's just across from Russell Square Gardens It's massive You could spend days in there I've been there maybe three times and there's still all sorts of different rooms and exhibits I haven't even gotten to yet UM Also the more touristy attractions such as the London Eye which I haven't been to yet UM but I have done some other kind of m more or less touristy things I've visited
