Okay um so I'm down in London for work um and I work I do need to so I'm down in London for work um and normally I work in Newcastle and that's where I live um but ah I've got kind of like a weird situation where my fellowship up in Newcastle was meant to be hosted in London and I can only do the testing for the fellowship in London um but Newcastle paid my salary so I live there and then they just give some money to ucl for me to do some work here um which is quite nice because I'm from London originally so I get to see my family and friends and stuff um but my expenses get paid by the university which is great um some things I like about London are so I um really like the diversity of London um and I've got um um one of my friends is really into um dressing really impressively I guess um properly um like a take on modern sort of dandy um with elaborate embroidery and stuff And um he always said that um basically whenever he was in London he just never felt like he stuck out M it was only other places that he felt like people were judging him for dressing weirdly So I really like that that basically you can do whatever you want and still fit in and there's also a lot of stuff going on in London generally It's really easy to find something to do in the evenings um but I guess the thing I don't like about London uh when I was living here so I lived here for um I grew up here so I lived here until I was 18 then I spent three years in the northeast of England and I came back down here for my PhD in my Master So I spent another five years in London and now I've moved to Newcastle um and so I've spent a long time living in London um and I guess the thing is that even though I said there's always something going on when I actually lived here I never actually went out and did any of that stuff um occasionally I go out for dinner somewhere um but the kind of stuff that people do when they visit London they go to um the theater um and stuff like that and I just never got around to it because I would always really exhausted um I feel like the pace of life is generally um a lot more hectic in London um and it's a lot more stressful because it's so expensive to live in London You have to live further out from where you work which means that you spend more time commuting and you just end up generally being tired at the end of the day is what I found So you don't actually have the energy to go out and do all the cool stuff um I guess my favorite cuisine um I go through sort of different phases of liking stuff My fiance is a massive foodie um and really I just go through phases Like he goes through phases of um making different stuff And whatever he makes that's my new thing um so he got really into tacos um and actually there are some quite good taco places in London um but I mean there's good taco places all over I think um and when I lived here probably my favorite place to go in it So I lived in finbury Park and there's like a little coffee shop called blitz in Finbu Park I used to really like going there for
