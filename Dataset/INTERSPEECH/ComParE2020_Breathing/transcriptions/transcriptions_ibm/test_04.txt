so i'm a very big fan of restaurants especially in london i think one of my favorite things is going to new restaurants and i read a lot of restaurant reviews to find out restaurants to go to i'm quite proud of the fact that i often tend to be the person to pick reference i go to friends i think have quite good taste in restaurants so in terms of a favorite restaurant i'd say that i would prefer going to a new restaurant to one that i've already been to but some very old reliable ones are quite like caravan which is a very nice chain of restaurants around london there's one in bank side this one in king's cross and they do really good sharing plate type food of rest once i haven't been to yet that i really like to go to black acts mangle is a very exciting looking turkish combat restaurant but done buyer proper sheff used to be at november it's quite odd to this quite posh food but then it's done in a restaurant that constantly plays heavy metal so i quite like to go that but they only have tables for about twenty people so that's my list of places i'd like to go to and has my favorite cuisine again i'm not quite sure it is quite like things that are new i spend time on instagram scrolling through looking at food funding new feet to eat saw a recipe recently in the garden from oslangi for a choco flan where you put in the cake mixture first and then the custard for the plan and then in the oven they swap places seen it with the flan on the top and the cake on the bottom which i think is really interesting i'd want to make it just going to see that so yeah what brings me to london will i grow up here i grew up in north london in mozzare hill and i went to school there then left a couple of years to get to uni and then very quickly decided that i probably wanted to do the rest of my studies and working in london so now i'm doing my phd a uco in euro science and i've stayed in london ever since but at the start of next year and twenty twenty i get moving to edinburgh for a couple of months to work with my entry partner for my phd where we will be developing the app for my project i'll be really exciting and i think eliberate looks like a really amazing city i tend to prefer to live in cities robert smaller places i think just having grown up with having everything within arms length then ways open i think it'd be quite odd going somewhere where you kind of have to do everything between nine and five um i think we bit depressing also i don't drive which is definitely a very north london thing so i would find it quite hot to leave a city but i'm very excited by moving to edinburgh for a short period of time what are some of things i like about london will have already listed a few missus so much to do in london and it's just so cultural and there's great food as i have mentioned at some length ps i definitely find it hard to leave london what do i not like about london i think some of things other people don't like about london and saying that london is quite cold quite harsh an unfriendly place i quite like that i quite like the anonymity that you have living in a big city i'm not sure what i don't like for london maybe i'll find out i mean i realize that it's a lot better have i've been to any of the parts and then i have been to some of the parks in london i quite like some james park i think it's quite nice i like the terror pens and the pelicans they have the which i think fun i grew up next to park or ali paley which that's just a really nice parking lot of my memories are either going for walks in a pale of my door with friends i don't know being a team
