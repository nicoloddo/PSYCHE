so my instrument and i've lived in london my whole life my favorite thing about london are the museums and of the community centers and yet to ease that you can do around now the pubs and the clubs i guess my favorite area would be south kensington around there at night's bridge to have loss of nice european food mast they have a talk about the things that you already get in other places in london i guess compared to where i live is nice apart as well that i have you have the bikes in london which did there isn't much in the rural areas as well but there are starts time to be bill out and i guess my favorite restaurant used to be nandles but it's now more i do like a buffer that there is a quite near my neighborhood so they serve lots of different types of food so they serve pizza and that my favorite food would be indian food to be honest late curry so it would be the curry and the chicken lamb and the different types of rises this displaces that they have which i do not some of the names and so they have the tales and stuff and stuff that was the pompo themselves which is something nice nothing nice which because of the indian my favorite fruit and yeah but i guess in london there isn't really too many indian places that i would go to to eight and so my favorite places would be close to my home in that regards and i guess i went to university in london and so while i was there that in impairer and south kansas and so that's another reason why sockets and is a favorite area of wine and then we have the other doing medicine so up when i was studying medicine i only done the best new the first year and so now i decided to work is still in london but you know also is interested in didn't research what was on the was interested in research that become an a fair prison psychiatrist by guess i was always thinking not you know i wasn't really into that the surgical aspects of medicine so we will see how to do every everything lenin calls but was really into kind of bodies and doing some of us are software up and find a different part and i i have referred it it'd be easy for me to start working out maybe go back to university letter on and so i'm i might go to imperial see little also from different courses that they offer similar things i guess i would still want to stay in london if i go to universe i guess got the idea of going to a place outside of london to local more rural area wouldn't be to entice it for me because i guess i have most of my school and earlier on done in a more rural saying than the london way and was there like the fact that it's near loss of different places different types of restaurants and stuff like that and i guess in london the best the best things usually are kind of just like in the senate so where you know where they have all the different museums like in lessons and square i'd recommend people to go to maybe the science museums and like the art museums
