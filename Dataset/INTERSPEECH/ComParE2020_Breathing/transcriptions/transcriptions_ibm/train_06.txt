so i moved to london because my partner is studying at university college london he is working on getting his phd in cognitive neuro science and we decided that it would be fun if i moved here as well so i came from the united states and i have been living here now since the twenty ninth of january two thousand nineteen so almost a full year it's been a very exciting journey it took me approximately eight or nine months to be able to make the move happen i worked as an respect home for almost two years and i had to go through an entire process to get my nursing license in my visa in order and now i work here and reading as a nurse new work on antibd's hermatology word and which is very different than the nursing i used to do i was previously a nurse in the intensive care unit and often worked with patience after cardioc surgeries earners and surgeries as well as various medical conditions like respiratory failure and now i am dealing primarily with medical patients who are generally not a sick and my patient were clothes much larger as well i was previously only working with two to three patients and now i work with an average of eight to ten patients which is quite a large difference so it was a very large adjustment period when i first came here i had to adjust first of all just to having more patience so there is a lot of prioritization and uh delegation that i needed to quickly learn in order to be efficient and practice safe nursing care um luckily i have been working with a great team and the team that i work with are from several different countries the nhs is currently having a massive nursing shortage so they often bring it nurses from the eu as well as other countries the agency i went through is actually based on the pilot and so there is a large philippine population at our hospital um as well as people from spain portugal um all over africa america is surprisingly as i have yet to meet another americaners but that's alright as so it's been it's been fun getting to know everyone from all these different countries and to have people with sort of a similar experience so um that definitely helped my transition period um and now the great friends and recently i got two experience with the nhs is like as a patient because i had a very severe chest infection when i had to go in ane and for a temperature of forty and my heart rate was over one thirty and they nearly admit it meets the hospital but likely i got a little better with some fluids and avian tobiotics uhm but it was uh it was very uhm interesting because it didn't really i had never even seen my my gp yet let alone go to any so he was messaging all my co workers my friends trying to figure out what to do and they were a great support system during that time which was really nice and it was actually quite a good experience apart from
