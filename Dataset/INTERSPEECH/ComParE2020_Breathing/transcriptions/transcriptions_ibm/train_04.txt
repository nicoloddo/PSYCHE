mm i came to london to go to school to go to university college london initially for the masters program in cognitive narrow science at the institute of congress normal science ucl and i've stayed in london to continue in cognitive neural science by doing a phd program here at the icn on my second year now and i'll probably stay in london and tell i'm finished and there's a few things i like about london at first the things that i didn't like so much or now in ways things that i do like there's a great deal available to you at you know a great convenience there's anything you want any kind of food or whatever you need you don't have to get in a car and you know drive half hour to get there everything's very close by that makes things convenient i like that that there's a lot to do there's a lot to still explore tons of museums there's a lot of restaurants i like to go to a number of restaurants particularly i would say my favorite is probably frankle monkas they have really good pizza and i have also explored a lot of different parks in london such as hyde park in a russell square gardens and ah regions park and as tons of parks if i had to choose a favourite i really like hyde park and i would maybe say that's my favour in london at least there's a lot in the uk if someone was new to the city i would recommend that they see a number of different sites and things such as museums and um those are always really interesting they're free some of it can be boring but you just gotta explore round and figure out what interests you in what you like i really like the british library going there for the first time is really cool they have a like artifact treasure room there that has also to really interesting old objects books and literature and paintings and i'd also probably recommend that someone knew to london visit thee the british liberal not the british library the british museum that's just a cross from brussels square gardens its massive you could spend days in there have been there maybe three times and there's still all sorts of different rooms and exhibits i haven't even gotten to yet um there is also the more touristy attractions such as the london eye which i haven't been to yet um but i have done some other kind of more less touristy things i've visited
