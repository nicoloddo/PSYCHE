i came to london for a master's degree at the real economy of music and i was there two years and i'm still there as a fellow in a string quartet which sounds fancy but means very little i like to go to galleries and museums that's probably my favorite thing to do in london i've seen some of the accidentians that take five times in the past couple months that's one of my favorite things that's available in the city and definitely one of the reasons i moved here i was want to move to new yorker london move somewhere that was a cultural mecca things that i don't like about london wow these actually i think i was asked all of these questions on a date i was on a few days ago it's hilarious i mean things i don't like about london there aren't really any either things that i miss from home like i miss the mountains in the ocean but that's not why we live in london and that's why i left is because thank you for people live there for the mountains in the ocean and they want to go skiing and hiking and can doing and they don't care about going to museums are going to watch music i favorite restaurant or cuisine i mean there's so much indian food here that's a big perk pretty cool i missed the asian food from bankover actually over half of the metro the population of metro vancouver this asian and the the chinese japanese taiwanese korean food is just incredible and i found it hard to find affordable hidden food in london but that's probably more the failure on my part then failure of the cities i've been to a lot of the parks i mean currently my favorite park is water low park just because it's such a close walk for my house so it's easy to kind of walk over every few days and explore although i do love the heath i have a roommate that swims in the ponds every single day even there though there are four degrees right now which seems a little bit crazy to me but also i kind of want to do it but unfortunately there there's only that though the ponds are gendered so in the winter i feel like i need to go with someone to egg me on you know and i i don't have anyone to egg me on alexis if you ever want to go so in the ponds and four degree weather please that would be a lot of fun and potentially terrifying an awful and we might both get sick and some kind of disease like are they clean i don't know the kind of a concerning colour in the summer so not to totally sure if you met someone new into the what would you recommend the go to i mean i i walk along the canals i love the canals i think it's those what they're on my favorite things when i moved but i think maybe because they ease me and to kind of through their like semi nature but they're so beautiful and it's a kind of the kind of remind me of the high line which is like one of my favorite things in the world walking on the high line with the witnee right next to you walking into house kitchen and cut the calls going to feel like that because the knowledge feel old and they it feels like a natural center but at the same time you have this incredible new infrastructure in these modern buildings in the drugs to position i just feel stunning it's a beautiful way to see the city and feel a sense of communists despite the cyclists zooming past and ring their bells and people yelling there still some of the chaos of london but also just it's still nice in a beauty the london i man again i totally i talked about the lend and i on the state i went on and i didn't like i just don't understand the whole the big deal at the lend and i i've never been maybe one day i'll go for a drink on the land and i and see what the view is like to sky garden that's cool i tried to book sky garden for my parents and i but it's totally booked up for the next few weeks which is sad but one day i'm sure i'll make it to the london i but i don't really i don't know
