so the great perimeter of geeze a bit made me think about churches and and which i hate going in them and when i read here that people might have been even paired for bearing building the pyramid i thought **** that when you going churches all you know is that people were forced to build them and that was supposed to like them and that the emblems of the most corrupt organization in the world ever and i even hit the smell of them and because when i was younger was top by nuns and forced to go to church every sunday and even serve on the ultra at seven o'clock in the morning one week a month i've never quite forgiven churches and i even hit the smell of them when i read about william herschel i thought we always concentrate on what people did that that worked similarly with newton we construct what he got right but he was also in not case and he worked on alchemy and tried to turn led into gold but hershel's bit of nuttery was that he actually believed that there were people who were living on the moon and he held quite strongly for a long period of his life to the belief that he had seen evidence of structures like trees and i can't remember the buildings but other things on the moon that proved that there were people people who who lived there same is true for line is pauling who won i think he wanted two mobile prizes one of chemistry monfa one for biology was in a race with watson and cricket for dna but he in later life had this mad naution that if you took loads and loads and lots of vitamin sea it would a bet cancer and cos i like to try things out i did that at one time and all it does is make you go to the bathroom and off a lot the north wind and the sun made me think of something that i've pieced music that i've been writing which he's actually called the north wind and i i wrote it for the impending death of one of my friends grandmothers um that's what that made me think of and the poetry made me think of nearer science there's an owner project i want to get one of my undergraduates to do which is can't remember the lab it came from but there's a great purpose showing how language are different words are maps in different in semantic structures in the brown and i have a hypothesis that if you take a top one hundred of shared spears metaphors and almost anybody else's cause he's ruined it for everybody else that the distance in these maps between shakespeare's matter metaphorical images the the the the things that he uses and other peoples will be greater and that one of the things that make seem so great is that he does actually stretch things across the he makes us travel greater distances in our brain the other thing that the point made me think of is about going to bed by dare because i'm i'm an obitual napper this morning go to meet a friend for breakfast at ten o'clock she lives an hour away i live ten minutes away and i was fifteen minutes late for a ten o'clock breakfast because i really can't do do mornings and i do go spend every day even if i come into the icn i'll i'll go home for a nap in the afternoon and in my office i used to have a bed and i removed it because too many people in the i c m were taking naps in my office and it begun to smell and um the second point didn't make me think of anything at all actually so i i i have nothing to say about that one counting from one to forty strangely made me think about brian butter with cause he works on numerical numerical cognition and he was one of the people who got me to be interested in how the brain processes numbers so that was what one to forty made me think of and then i started to get nervous cause i thought all gosh what if the next test is kind of harder and i have to count backwards in sevens and and
