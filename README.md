# Breath and Speech Synthesis (WIP)

Main topics: Breath and Speech Synthesis (WIP): Speech Synthesis, Natural Language Processing, Affective Computing, Data Engineering in Python.
Working in process (WIP).
Expected delivery: October 2023.

## The project involves:
Evaluation of State of The Art Speech Synthesizers for emotional speech synthesis with breathing and disfluencies. The Speech is then applied in a gamified experiment on users' empathic response to the breathing agent.

- Evaluation and adaptation of Speech Synthesis Deep Learning models for breathing and spontaneous speech
- Utilization of various Cloud Computing services: IBM Cloud, AssemblyAI, Google Cloud
- Gamified Evaluation of the emotional impact of breathing in synthesised voices for virtual agents (on Unity, C#) [On the repo Gamified Psyche]
- Prompt engineering on the model BARK for spontaneous speech synthesis with emotional features and breathing.
