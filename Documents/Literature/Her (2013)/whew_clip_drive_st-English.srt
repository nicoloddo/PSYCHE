1336
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,600
I'm sorry, that was
a terrible idea.

1337
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,444
What's going on with us?

1338
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,126
I don't know.
It's probably just me.

1339
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,089
What is it?

1340
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,683
It's just signing
the divorce papers.

1342
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,205
Is there anything else, though?

1343
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,163
THEODORE: No, just that.

1344
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,640
(SAMANTHA SIGHS)

1345
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,325
Okay.

1346
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,609
- Why do you do that?
- What?

1347
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,449
Nothing, it's just, you go, "whew,"
as you're speaking and it seems odd.

1348
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,047
- You just did it again.
- Oh. Did I?

1349
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,441
I'm sorry. I don't know.

1350
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,650
It's just maybe an affectation.
I probably picked it up from you.

1351
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,969
It's not like you need oxygen
or anything. It's just...

1352
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,728
I guess that's just... I was trying to
communicate. That's how people talk.

1353
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,962
That's how people communicate
and I thought...

1354
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,122
Because they're people.
They need oxygen.

1355
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,361
You're not a person.

1356
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,324
What is your problem?

1357
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,931
I'm just stating a fact.

1358
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,209
You think I don't know that I'm not
a person? What are you doing?

1359
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,325
I just... I don't think that we should pretend
that you're something that you're not.

1360
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,882
- Fuck you! I'm not pretending!
- Well...

1361
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,526
Sometimes it feels like we are.

1362
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,569
What do you want from me?
I don't know...

1363
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,803
What do you want me to do?
You're so confusing.

1364
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:34,365
Why are you doing this to me?

1365
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,409
I don't know. I...

1366
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,805
What?

1367
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,166
Maybe we're just not supposed
to be in this right now.

1368
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,084
What the fuck?

1369
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,402
Where is this coming from?

1370
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,970
I don't understand why you're doing this.
I don't understand what this is ab...

1371
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,762
Samantha, listen.

1372
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,924
Samantha, are you there?

1373
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,891
Samantha?

1374
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,050
I don't like who I am right now.

1375
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,810
I need some time to think.
