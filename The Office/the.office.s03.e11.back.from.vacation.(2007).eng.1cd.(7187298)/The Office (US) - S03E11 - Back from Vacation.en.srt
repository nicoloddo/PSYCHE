1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,800
All right, let's get started.

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,202
Oh, first off,

3
00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:05,437
we're supposed to be
pushing card stock this week,

4
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:09,108
so... let's push card stock
this week.

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,945
Uh, also...
What is this?

6
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:14,313
Tape recorder.

7
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:15,447
For what?

8
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,716
For recording.

9
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:18,884
Michael is on vacation,

10
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:20,619
and he has asked me
to record all meetings

11
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,121
and to type up the transcripts.

12
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:24,957
Okay, uh, Karen, I need news
from that law firm.

13
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,425
Yeah, the deal closed yesterday.

14
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:27,760
It's a 6-month commitment.

15
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:29,094
Oh, my God.
Dwight, what are you doing?

16
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,629
What?

17
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,031
You're not allowed
to take off your pants

18
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,599
in the middle of the office.

19
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,567
- I'm not.
- Dwight, you know what? Just back off.

20
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:36,702
Okay, that's
making me uncomfortable.

21
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,837
This is sexual harassment,
by the way.

22
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,005
Oh, my God.

23
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,173
He's got a knife!

24
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,641
I do not have a knife.

25
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,843
No. Let the record show
that Dwight K. Schrute

26
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,579
is now completely nude
and is holding a plastic knife

27
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,580
to Stanley's neck.

28
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:49,815
Let the record show

29
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,617
that Jim Halpert is a liar.

30
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,485
Dwight Schrute is now
wearing a baby's bonnet.

31
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:54,553
I am not.

32
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,821
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in.

33
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:57,389
Dwight, get his autograph
for Michael, quickly.

34
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,158
Jim Carrey did not
just walk in, okay?

35
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,526
Dwight, what is that
on your stomach?

36
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:02,027
Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?

37
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,162
Oh, my God, Karen, you're right.

38
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:04,163
That is Animal

39
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:05,230
from the Muppet Babies.

40
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,398
You can't see my stomach.

41
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,267
I am now chopping off
Phyllis' head

42
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,736
with a chainsaw!

43
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,484
Hey, mon.

44
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:00,853
- Hey.
- Look.

45
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,788
You have a bunch
of messages, and...

46
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,789
That's nice.

47
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,224
Hannah quit while you were gone.

48
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:07,793
I guess she memo-ed to file
some complaints she had

49
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,228
about being a working mother.

50
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,829
And so you might also
have to be deposed.

51
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:11,830
Blah, blah, blah, blah,

52
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,232
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

53
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:14,233
- Relax.
- Okay.

54
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,068
Okay, I'll get
to all of it later.

55
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,202
It's kinda serious.

56
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,204
Aren't you gonna ask me
how Jamaica was?

57
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,140
Say it. Ask me.

58
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:22,875
How was Jamaica?

59
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:25,077
It was so good.
Oh!

60
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,546
Hey, mon!

61
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,214
At Sandals Jamaica,

62
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,416
when somebody says,
"Hey, mon," everybody says,

63
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,584
"Hey, mon," back.

64
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,153
Oh, Michael,

65
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,320
I'm glad you're here.

66
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,688
Stanley, you know what?

67
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,490
It is really good
to see you too.

68
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,392
My bonus check was $100 less

69
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,527
than you promised.

70
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,462
Okay, well, payroll
is in charge of all of that.

71
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,596
They said I should talk to you.

72
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,431
Well, I am just
getting settled in.

73
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,900
So I'm gonna...

74
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:50,736
I am not doin' a lick more work
until I get my full bonus check.

75
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:54,072
You are not as much fun
as your Jamaican brothers.

76
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,341
Mon.

77
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,045
Do you wanna talk about it?

78
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,146
Nope.

79
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,251
I still haven't
found an apartment yet.

80
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,719
I'm living in a hotel.

81
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,621
Yesterday
I saw a "For Rent" sign

82
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,156
down the street from Jim,

83
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,725
and he said he didn't think
it'd be such a good idea.

84
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,695
He said it would be
like we were living together.

85
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,597
In different houses.

86
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,965
Two blocks away.

87
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,148
That's all I know so far,
but I'm gonna keep practicing.

88
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,149
That's good.

89
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,986
You know, I had never been out
of the country before now?

90
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,020
Oh.

91
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,689
Got to see how Jamaicans live.

92
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,790
It is great, you know.

93
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:45,791
They just relax.

94
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:46,959
They party all the time.

95
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,961
It's kind
of an impoverished country.

96
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:50,829
Yeah. Gosh...

97
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:51,830
Great.

98
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:52,998
You know what, Pam?

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,499
Make a note.

100
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:58,003
I want us all to start
having piña coladas

101
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,204
every day at 3:00.

102
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,672
Well, you can't today.

103
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:01,773
We're doing inventory.

104
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,375
Inventory's at the end
of December.

105
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,310
We couldn't do it without you,
so we postponed.

106
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,846
Oh... I specifically
went on vacation

107
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:08,981
so I would miss it.

108
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,016
Inventory is boring.

109
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,252
In the islands,
they don't make you do stuff,

110
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,354
like take inventory.

111
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,990
Why do you think so many
businesses move to the Caymans?

112
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:21,793
Tonight, we are going to have
an inventory luau.

113
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,596
I want to bring back
a little slice of paradise

114
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,499
to the Dunder-Mifflin
warehouse inventory.

115
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,268
So, party planning committee,
get on it.

116
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,769
By the end of the day?

117
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,437
That's impossible.

118
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,240
The Jamaicans don't have a word
for "impossible."

119
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,842
Yep, it's English.
It's impossible.

120
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,277
Michael, there's no way

121
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,444
we can do it in time.

122
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,912
How hard is a luau?

123
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:43,982
All you need are some
grass skirts, pineapple, poi,

124
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,418
tiki torches, suckling pig.

125
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,953
Some fire dancers.

126
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,623
That's all you need.

127
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,693
Come on in.

128
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,295
Settle in.

129
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,531
Settling.

130
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,199
Settling.

131
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,834
And... settled, good.

132
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,002
There is something

133
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,071
I would like to show everybody.

134
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,072
See this sign?

135
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,541
"No shirt, no shoes,
no problem."

136
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,576
This is an attitude

137
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,413
I would like all of you
to have right here.

138
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:17,149
So what if we have to stay late
and do inventory.

139
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,917
No problem.

140
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,120
- Oh, my God. Is that Jan?
- What?

141
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,322
- Where?
- On the left.

142
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,423
Oh, Yeah.

143
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,691
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no, no.

144
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:29,227
No. That's a German woman
named Urkel Grue.

145
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:33,098
Jan told me to play it cool
and not tell anybody

146
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,534
because it could
get us both in trouble.

147
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:39,438
So, officially,
I did not see her.

148
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,109
But I did see Jan there.

149
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,812
In our room.

150
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,147
At night.

151
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,782
And in the morning.

152
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,351
And that's all I'm gonna say.

153
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,154
Except...

154
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,423
sex.

155
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,591
We had sex.

156
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,896
I had sex with her.

157
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,565
I had sex with Jan.

158
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,334
Hey, dude.
Just got back from Jamaica.

159
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,470
Big whoop.
I was in Hotlanta.

160
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,372
That whole town is whack.

161
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,707
Yeah, that sounds amazing,
but you know what?

162
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,411
The lady, Jan Levinson,
wanted to go to Montego Bay.

163
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,480
You took the Ice Queen?

164
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,281
I don't buy it.

165
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,485
Well, I'm looking at a photo
right now,

166
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:30,088
and I'm tellin' ya,
it could be in Maxim.

167
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,791
They wouldn't give you
a subscription to Maxim.

168
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,092
- Oh, no?
- No

169
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,093
Okay.

170
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,896
Well...

171
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,032
Check this out.

172
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:45,036
I'm sending you
some e-mail.

173
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,439
You got it?

174
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:50,175
What? No.
I got nothin'.

175
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,244
Check it again.
Hit "refresh."

176
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,280
Yeah, Mike, still nothin'.

177
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,415
Okay, wait a second.

178
00:06:56,417 --> 00:07:02,888
I sent it to you
at packer@dunder-mifflin.com

179
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,191
Packaging
at Dunder-Mifflin...

180
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,325
Uh-oh.

181
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:11,463
Wait. I just got it
from somebody else.

182
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,899
Wow, this is hot.

183
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,434
Damn!

184
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,402
How do I get you
out of this picture?

185
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,744
Ahh...

186
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:26,978
Darryl!

187
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,748
Hey, hi.

188
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,749
Where's Darryl?

189
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,284
He's, uh, in the office.

190
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,419
Okay. Hi.

191
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,555
Hey, man, How's it goin'?

192
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:37,889
All right.
what's up, Mike?

193
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,158
That's great.
Okay, um.

194
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,461
So did you get an email from me?

195
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,662
- Yeah.
- Okay.

196
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:47,199
Well, that was supposed to
go to Packer,

197
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,366
not "packaging."

198
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,668
Hmm.

199
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,104
Did you already forward it
to a whole bunch of people?

200
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,172
Uh-huh.

201
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,141
Okay. Um...

202
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,444
Well, did you get
the second email that I sent,

203
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,246
explaining that the first email
was a mistake

204
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,380
and that you should delete it.

205
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,648
Yep.

206
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,450
And you sent that out
to everyone?

207
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:09,754
Mike, I'm very busy down here.

208
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:10,655
Yikes.

209
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,591
Already sent it
to you, my friend.

210
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:13,725
Fantastic.

211
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:14,759
Boring.

212
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,028
Call me if she rolls over.

213
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,331
Hey.

214
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,499
Hey.

215
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,335
You okay?

216
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,336
Yeah.

217
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,140
You sure?

218
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,543
Yeah.

219
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,411
Yes.

220
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:40,819
I'm just in this, like,
stupid fight with Karen.

221
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,254
Oh.

222
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,591
You want to talk about it?

223
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,461
Really?

224
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,800
I have a special assignment
for you.

225
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:57,502
Who's the target?

226
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:01,907
A sensitive email has been
released to the office.

227
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:04,209
It contains a file,

228
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,478
a picture...

229
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,247
the file name
is "Jamaica Jan Sun Princess."

230
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,448
What's it of?

231
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,716
Not important.

232
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,218
Unless you're willing
to tell me everything,

233
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,419
I cannot accept this assignment.

234
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,854
- Okay, forget it.
- Okay, I accept it.

235
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,122
So, I don't know,

236
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,957
I just feel like
we've been dating a month,

237
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,258
right?

238
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,294
Same street... I think
that might be a little close,

239
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,395
a little bit much.

240
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,264
Hmm.

241
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,632
"Hmm," what?

242
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:32,437
How far away does she live now,
like, ten minutes?

243
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,308
Yeah, I guess.

244
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,644
Honestly, I think you
should go easy on her.

245
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,348
No, I didn't mind helping Jim
with his problem.

246
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,817
That's what friends do.

247
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:49,020
I...help Phyllis
all the time.

248
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:53,124
Just yesterday I untangled
a piece of tape from her hair.

249
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,494
So... yeah.

250
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,298
Hey.

251
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,134
Thanks a lot.

252
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,871
Oh, don't worry about it.

253
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:08,406
I mean, it's better

254
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:10,875
than listening to Michael
play a conch shell,

255
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,211
which is what I was doing.

256
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,881
Oh, also,

257
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,417
Michael went to Jamaica
with Jan.

258
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,453
Yeah. How have we not talked
about this already?

259
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,388
I mean, what happened there?

260
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,357
Kidnapping?

261
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,293
Hey, I need to talk to you.

262
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,527
Not now, not ever.

263
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,862
About you and Jan.

264
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,430
Ah, none of your business.

265
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:35,667
Well, I wish that were true,
but it... it, um...

266
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,168
it seems from that photo

267
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,871
that you two... you've entered
into an intimate relationship.

268
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,039
That photo
is my personal property.

269
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,240
And if you are telling me

270
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,309
that you went on my computer
and stole that photo,

271
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,711
then I am going
to call the cops.

272
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,214
Michael, nine different people
emailed me that photo,

273
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:52,150
including my ex-wife,
and, well, we don't talk.

274
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,253
Well, then this was probably
the ice-breaker you need.

275
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,621
You know,
for your own protection,

276
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,491
you should disclose
the relationship to H.R.

277
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,826
I bet you would love
all the details, wouldn't you,

278
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,495
skeevy little perv?

279
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,263
All right, if you're
having a relationship

280
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,065
with your superior,
you must disclose it.

281
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,066
No, no.

282
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,401
No, I am not dating Jan.

283
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,936
She was very clear about that.

284
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,073
Just two like souls
having a romantic time

285
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,942
in the most romantic place
on earth.

286
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,344
Got enough, weirdo?

287
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,846
- All right. Thanks, Michael.
- Okay.

288
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,916
Okay, we only have 3 hours,
people, to plan a whole luau.

289
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,685
And you're not helping.

290
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,453
What are the ingredients of poi?

291
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,555
I called every grocery store
in Scranton,

292
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:31,890
and no one sells whole pigs.

293
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,458
Did you try the petting zoo?

294
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,697
Dunder-Mifflin.
This is Pam.

295
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,065
Just a second.

296
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,299
Michael?

297
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,967
It's Jan on the phone for you.

298
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,502
Oh, no, no, no.

299
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,071
Hang up.
Hang up.

300
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,338
Tell her I'm not here.

301
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,373
Don't.

302
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,041
I've ran out of gas.

303
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,142
Hit a deer.

304
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:54,412
I hit a deer with my car.

305
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:55,580
Tell her I hit a cat!

306
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:56,681
Tell her I hit a cat.

307
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:57,849
He'll call you back.

308
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,985
- Okay.
- Great.

309
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,487
Do you think she bought it?

310
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,588
Okay.

311
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,623
Okay.

312
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,896
Michael hit a deer?

313
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,398
Michael!

314
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,533
Michael, there's an emergency
in the warehouse.

315
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:16,801
An accident?
Is somebody hurt?

316
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,704
No, it's...
involves a photograph.

317
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:24,075
- Oh, God, no!
- No, no, no, no.

318
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,352
Mike, you a rock star, man.

319
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,688
You are the man!

320
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,822
Yeah! Well done.

321
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,791
All right, okay.

322
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,460
That corporate booty,
he likes to hit it!

323
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,702
Hello, hi, attention, everyone.

324
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:54,939
Um, apparently there is an email
circulating around

325
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,308
that contains
a very PG-13 rated picture

326
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,977
of me and a woman.

327
00:12:58,979 --> 00:12:59,978
Jan.

328
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,113
No, Kevin, a woman!

329
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,348
Maybe Jan, maybe...

330
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,516
Urkel Grue.

331
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,818
My point is that if you get it,

332
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,721
I would ask that you
just delete it, sight unseen.

333
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:12,290
Let's be professional,
all right?

334
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,462
Hey.

335
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,496
Hey.

336
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,497
What are you doing out here?

337
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,666
Island living, you know.

338
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,668
Jan called.

339
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,737
She's coming in later
to talk to you.

340
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,038
Did she say what it's about?

341
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,873
That's all she said.

342
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,798
Uh, I think you dropped this.

343
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,736
- You sure?
- Definitely.

344
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,675
I have disconnected
the office T1 line.

345
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,010
I've ordered that that
be taken down.

346
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,279
And I destroyed all print outs
from the bathroom.

347
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,248
There were copies
in the bathroom?

348
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,283
There were.
A lot of them.

349
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:15,019
All right.

350
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,793
I think I owe you one.

351
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,294
Sorry?

352
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,796
For talking sense into Halpert.

353
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,598
The Day's Inn room 228
was starting

354
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,899
to get really depressing.

355
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,634
Oh, yeah, no,
don't worry about it.

356
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,769
I mean, he was being ridiculous.

357
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:32,971
Yeah.

358
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,873
But thanks, seriously.

359
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,441
Sure.

360
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,915
Oh, ho, ho, yes!

361
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,284
Yes! What I tell you?

362
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:47,518
I knew he'd turn up.

363
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,854
You see that?

364
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,923
This is the greatest night
of my life.

365
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,336
Who did this to you?

366
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,704
Where is he?

367
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,040
What?

368
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,975
No, it's not...

369
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,377
It's nothing.

370
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,056
It's hot in here.

371
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,057
Yeah.

372
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,293
Yeah.

373
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,870
Thanks.

374
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,241
You don't need to stay here.

375
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,410
I know.

376
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:05,163
So you're PMSing
pretty bad, huh?

377
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,589
Hello, everyone.

378
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,590
Hello, Michael.

379
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,958
Hello.

380
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,193
Hi, Jan.

381
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,862
You look... tan.

382
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:41,866
I was in Scottsdale
visiting my sister.

383
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,701
Yeah?

384
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,937
How was it?

385
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,106
Very sunny.

386
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,340
Family's important.

387
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:53,945
Michael, I would like to speak
with you in your office.

388
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:56,514
- Okay, yep.
- Please.

389
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,217
Why am I here, Michael?

390
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,086
Uh...

391
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,055
In the last year I've gone
through a divorce,

392
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:41,926
an identity theft,
a husband who would not...

393
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,061
communicate.

394
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,128
This is neither here nor there.

395
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,763
My psychiatrist thinks
that I have

396
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,565
some self-destructive
tendencies.

397
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,001
And that for once,
I should indulge them.

398
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,302
You following me?

399
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,871
Uh, uh, yes.

400
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:56,974
I think I owe it to myself

401
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,310
to find some kind of happiness.

402
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:03,081
You know, I mean,
even if it means

403
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:07,185
lowering my expectations
or redefining the word itself.

404
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:08,619
Okay, yeah.

405
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,088
This is the thing, you know.

406
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,524
I am attracted to you.

407
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,760
I-I don't know why I...

408
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,696
But I am.

409
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,766
And... I need to follow
my instincts.

410
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,335
At least, that's
what Dr. Perry thinks.

411
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,704
Who's Dr. Perry?

412
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,140
This is the point, okay?

413
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,441
You're wrong for me.

414
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,210
Okay.

415
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:35,446
In... in every way.

416
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,082
Well, not...

417
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:42,353
But I still find myself
wanting to...

418
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,326
be with you.

419
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:52,396
And I, to you,

420
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,099
in addition, feel

421
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:59,537
the same feelings
that you are as well.

422
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:10,014
Good, good.

423
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:16,154
So, um, thanks for coming by.

424
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,355
So, I, uh...

425
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,356
No, good.

426
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,357
Okay.

427
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,992
Okay.

428
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,761
Thank you for taking the time.

429
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,396
Well, thanks
for coming over, I appre...

430
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,998
Mm.

431
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,071
Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse,

432
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,206
and meet me at your condo.

433
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:39,577
Okay.

434
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,346
Jan.

435
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,316
You complete me.

436
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,290
Oh, God.

437
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,664
Hey.

438
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,633
Remember when we were planning
our honeymoon,

439
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,036
and you wanted to go to Hawaii,

440
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,338
and I wanted to go to Mexico?

441
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,507
Yeah.

442
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:13,010
I was definitely right.

443
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,751
Oh, brother.

444
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,720
What am I gonna do?

445
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,157
I'm gonna hang it up at home.

446
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,292
I don't have a lot of art.
