1
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,347
(Jim)
All right, let's get started.

2
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,099
Oh, first off,

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,183
we're supposed to be
pushing card stock this week,

4
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:21,396
so...let's push card stock
this week.

5
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,733
Uh, also--
What is this?

6
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,192
Tape recorder.

7
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,318
For what?

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,404
For recording.

9
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,739
Michael is on vacation,

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,490
and he has asked me
to record all meetings

11
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,616
and to type up the transcripts.

12
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:35,744
Okay, uh, Karen,

13
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,828
any news
from that law firm?

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,329
Yeah, the deal
closed yesterday.

15
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,748
It's a 6-month commitment.

16
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,832
Oh, my God.
Dwight, what are you doing?

17
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,625
What?

18
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,543
You're not allowed
to take off your pants

19
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,586
in the middle of the office.

20
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,171
I'm not.

21
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,505
Dwight, you know what?
Just back off.

22
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,673
Okay, that's
making me uncomfortable.

23
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,425
This is sexual harassment,
by the way.

24
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,801
Oh, my God.

25
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,178
He's got a knife!

26
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,637
I do not have a knife.

27
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,848
No. Let the record show
that Dwight K. Schrute

28
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,683
is now completely nude
and is holding a plastic knife

29
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,518
to Stanley's neck.

30
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,686
(Dwight)
Let the record show

31
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,605
that Jim Halpert
is a liar.

32
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,357
Dwight Schrute is now
wearing a baby's bonnet.

33
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,483
I am not.

34
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,776
Oh, Jim Carrey
just walked in.

35
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,361
Dwight, get his autograph
for Michael, quickly.

36
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,196
(Dwight)
Jim Carrey did not
just walk in, okay?

37
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,238
Dwight, what is that
on your stomach?

38
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,240
Is that
a Muppet Babiestattoo?

39
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,117
(Jim)
Oh, my God, Karen,
you're right.

40
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:17,369
That is Animal
from the Muppet Babies.

41
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,079
You can't see my stomach.

42
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,664
I am now chopping off
Phyllis' head with a chainsaw!

43
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,380
[imitates engine revving,
clears throat]

44
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,383
[upbeat piano music]

45
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:38,306
* *

46
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,915
(Michael)
I just had the best, most
romantic week of my life

47
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,167
in Sandals Jamaica.

48
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,253
Went with a lady.

49
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,714
And we laid on the beach
and drank fruity drinks...

50
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,215
for free.

51
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,675
Because it was all-inclusive.

52
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:17,512
And then I flew back
to Scranton,

53
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,557
and then they lost one
of my bags.

54
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,769
* Hey, Mr. Tally Man,
tally me bananas *

55
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,565
* Six hand, seven hand,
eight hand, brunch *

56
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,607
So delicious.

57
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,192
Dinner too.

58
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,903
You know how they say,
"Take a chill pill"?

59
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,780
In Jamaica, I took one.

60
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,324
A guy on the beach sold it
to me for $40,

61
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,743
and after I finished vomiting,

62
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,746
I was more relaxed
than I ever have been.

63
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,832
Lost six pounds too.

64
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,667
That's how I want
every day to be.

65
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,925
Oh, home sweet home.

66
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,927
Think I'll have to talk
about my trip much?

67
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,180
[grunts]
Okay.

68
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,981
[Jamaican accent]
Hey, mon.

69
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,734
Hey.
Look.

70
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,611
You have a bunch
of messages, and--

71
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,904
That's nice.

72
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,238
Hannah quit
while you were gone.

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,491
I guess she memo-ed to file
some complaints she had

74
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,825
about being a working mother.

75
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,285
And so you might also
have to be deposed.

76
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,411
Blah, blah,
blah, blah,

77
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,496
blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

78
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,663
Relax.
Okay.

79
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,831
Just relax.

80
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,791
Okay, I'll get
to all of it later.

81
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,459
It's kinda serious.

82
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,835
Aren't you gonna ask me
how Jamaica was?

83
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,713
[whispers]
Say it. Ask me.

84
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,798
How was Jamaica?

85
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,509
It was so good.
Oh!

86
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,596
Michael sends me a postcard
from every vacation he goes on.

87
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,390
Atlantic City...

88
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,517
he wishes I was here.

89
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,352
Busch Gardens, Virginia...

90
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,896
"all I got was this lousy
postcard."

91
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,022
And this time,

92
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,859
I'm "Ja-maken" him "crazy."

93
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,529
I don't know how far away he
thought he was,

94
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,282
because he put $10 worth
of stamps on this.

95
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,576
Hey, mon!

96
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,328
At Sandals Jamaica,

97
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,372
when somebody says,
"Hey, mon," everybody says,

98
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,665
"Hey, mon," back.

99
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,874
(Stanley)
Oh, Michael,

100
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,875
I'm glad you're here.

101
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,544
Stanley, you know what?

102
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,045
It is really good
to see you too.

103
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,797
My bonus check
was $100 less

104
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,048
than you promised.

105
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,717
Okay, well, payroll
is in charge of all of that.

106
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,051
They said I should
talk to you.

107
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,803
Well, I am just
getting settled in.

108
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,888
So I'm gonna...

109
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,641
I am not doin' a lick more work
until I get my full bonus check.

110
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,853
You are not as much fun
as your Jamaican brothers.

111
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,813
Mon.

112
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,734
Do you wanna talk
about it?

113
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,360
Nope.

114
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,323
I still haven't
found an apartment yet.

115
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,616
I'm living in a hotel.

116
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,452
Yesterday
I saw a "For Rent" sign

117
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,412
down the street from Jim,

118
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,748
and he said he didn't think
it'd be such a good idea.

119
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,459
He said it would be
like we were living together.

120
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,419
In different houses.

121
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,798
Two blocks away.

122
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,924
Hello.
You're back.

123
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,092
Yeah, mon.

124
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,095
Me's just got back to the
office.

125
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,347
While you were gone...

126
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,725
Me had an iry time.

127
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,934
While you were gone...

128
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,353
Jim glued my desk drawers
together;

129
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,645
he changed my voicemail

130
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,856
so that my voice sounded
like a chipmunk;

131
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,941
he told me that we had
a meeting at 4:00am,

132
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,360
and I was the only one
who showed up.

133
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,320
Dwight, please, please--
He turned over my--

134
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,573
I just got back
from vacation, mon.

135
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,866
All right?

136
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,951
So chill.

137
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,953
Let's--don't--

138
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,665
Don't harsh my mellow, mon.

139
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,417
I took a vacation once.

140
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,877
Never again.

141
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,380
While I was away, Jim had my
desk shipped to me...

142
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,839
in Roswell.

143
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,967
Presents!
I got presents for everybody.

144
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,053
Dwight, a genuine
Rastafarian wig.

145
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,471
Unbelievable.

146
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,599
Andy, I got you a genuine
Jamaican t-shirt.

147
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,809
They love Milli Vanilli down
there.

148
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,479
I give thanks, mon.
You are so welcome, mon.

149
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,648
Angela...

150
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,024
you just got lei'd.

151
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,025
No, I didn't.

152
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,568
Yes, you did.

153
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,695
[laughs] Okay.

154
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,573
Um...oh. Pam.

155
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,158
I forgot to get you something.

156
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,159
That's okay.

157
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,661
I'm just kidding.

158
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,747
Coconuts for your coconuts!

159
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,748
No.

160
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,500
[laughing]

161
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,626
Try it on.

162
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,627
No.

163
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,878
Go ahead.

164
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,047
Let me know if I miscalculated
the size.

165
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,883
I don't think I did.

166
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,968
Thank you.

167
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,805
Stanley, I got you some ganja.

168
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,848
I'm just kidding.

169
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,474
It's coffee.

170
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,642
I bet you wish it was ganja.

171
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,519
I wish it was $100.

172
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,021
[sighs]

173
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,482
I did a little scuba diving
at Sandals Jamaica.

174
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,861
And I learned about a thing
called decompression.

175
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,946
Which means if you're under
water,

176
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,614
and you rise too quickly,

177
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,199
you can die.

178
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,659
It didn't apply to me

179
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,036
because I was in the shallow
end of the pool.

180
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,704
But coming back here,

181
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,456
it does apply.

182
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,584
I can't just start my job up
immediately.

183
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,962
I need time to decompress.

184
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:04,716
Or I will die.

185
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,134
(Michael)
* Feelin' *

186
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,219
* Hot, hot, hot *

187
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,681
* Feelin' hot, hot, hot *

188
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,768
* Feelin' hot, hot, hot *

189
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,772
* Feelin' hot, hot, hot *

190
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,732
That's all I know so far,
but I'm gonna keep practicing.

191
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,775
That's good.

192
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,651
[playing steel drum]

193
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,570
You know, I had never been out
of the country before now?

194
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,780
Oh.

195
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,239
Got to see
how Jamaicans live.

196
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,657
It is great, you know.

197
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,701
They just relax.
They party all the time.

198
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,578
It's kind
of an impoverished country.

199
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,580
Yeah. Gosh...

200
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,748
Great.

201
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,584
You know what, Pam?
Make a note.

202
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,253
I want us all to start
having piña coladas

203
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,922
every day at 3:00.

204
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,508
Well, you can't today.
We're doing inventory.

205
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,009
Inventory's at the end
of December.

206
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,928
We couldn't do it without you,
so we postponed.

207
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,722
Oh...I specifically
went on vacation

208
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:53,723
so I would miss it.

209
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,892
Inventory is boring.

210
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,811
In the islands,
they don't make you do stuff,

211
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,270
like take inventory.

212
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,774
Why do you think so many
businesses move to the Caymans?

213
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,277
Tonight, we are going to have
an inventory luau.

214
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,572
I want to bring back
a little slice of paradise

215
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,117
to the Dunder-Mifflin
warehouse inventory.

216
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,952
So, party planning committee,
get on it.

217
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,080
By the end of the day?
That's impossible.

218
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,874
The Jamaicans don't have a word
for "impossible."

219
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,584
Yep, it's English.
It's impossible.

220
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,836
Michael,
there's no way

221
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,962
we can do it in time.

222
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,630
How hard is a luau?

223
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,216
All you need are some
grass skirts, pineapple, poi,

224
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,593
tiki torches, suckling pig.

225
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,679
Some fire dancers.

226
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,182
That's all you need.

227
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,269
Okay, let me tell you
a little story.

228
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,188
When I was on vacation,

229
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,607
I met a man named Bavan.

230
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,653
And Bavan takes people
parasailing.

231
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,196
And you know what
he said to me?

232
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:56,161
He said that he loves going
to work every day.

233
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,954
How many of you can
say that you love

234
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,914
going to work
every day like Bavan?

235
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,963
No one.

236
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,590
(Kevin)
But, Michael,

237
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,801
Buvan gets to go parasailing
every day, and that's fun.

238
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,803
His name is Bavan.
And you know what?

239
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,015
I'm sure Bavan gets sick
of his job too.

240
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,059
I'm sure he would like to take
a day off.

241
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,187
I'm sure he would like to spend
a vacation selling paper.

242
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,773
But he has the right attitude.

243
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,360
And that is something that you
learn when you go to Jamaica

244
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,737
and you really apply yourself.

245
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,073
I would love to take them all
to Jamaica.

246
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,116
But is that good management?

247
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,368
Yes.

248
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,371
But is it the best management?

249
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,373
Well, I can't afford it.

250
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,166
And corporate won't pay for it.

251
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,251
So who's the real criminal?

252
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,254
Come on in.

253
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,716
Settle in.

254
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,718
Settling.

255
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,844
Settling.

256
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,262
And...settled, good.

257
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,389
There is something

258
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,683
I would like to
show everybody.

259
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,850
See this sign?

260
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,186
"No shirt, no shoes,
no problem."

261
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,271
This is an attitude

262
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,024
I would like all of you
to have right here.

263
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,735
So what if we have to stay late
and do inventory.

264
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,195
No problem.

265
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,281
Oh, my God.
Is that Jan?
What?

266
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,074
(Dwight)
Where?
(Pam)
On the left.

267
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,033
Oh, Yeah.

268
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,743
Oh, my God!
No, no, no, no.

269
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,997
No. That's a German woman
named Urkel Grue.

270
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,625
Michael and Jan together in
Jamaica.

271
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,256
I guess I would just need a
little bit more evidence

272
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,634
than seeing it
with my own eyes.

273
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,264
I don't know if Michael and Jan
really went to Jamaica,

274
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,141
because Michael's way
into Photoshop.

275
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,350
For example,

276
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,020
I never went with him to Egypt.

277
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,692
Jan told me to play it cool
and not tell anybody

278
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,944
because it could
get us both in trouble.

279
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,406
So, officially,
I did not see her.

280
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,452
But I did see Jan there.

281
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,079
In our room.

282
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,456
At night.

283
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,292
And in the morning.

284
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,127
And that's all I'm gonna say.

285
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,050
Except...sex.

286
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,301
We had sex.

287
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,429
[chuckles]

288
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,307
I had sex with her.

289
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,975
I had sex with Jan.

290
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,269
Hey, dude.
Just got back from Jamaica.

291
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,980
(Packer)
Big whoop.
I was in Hotlanta.

292
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,815
That whole town is whack.

293
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,318
Yeah, that sounds amazing,
but you know what?

294
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,488
The lady, Jan Levinson,
wanted to go to Montego Bay.

295
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,947
You took
the Ice Queen?

296
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,991
[chuckles]
I don't buy it.

297
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,912
Well, I'm looking at a photo
right now,

298
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,332
and I'm tellin' ya,
it could be in Maxim.

299
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,959
They wouldn't give you
a subscription to Maxim.

300
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,169
Oh, no?
No

301
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,170
Okay.

302
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,005
Well...

303
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,298
[sighs]

304
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,218
Check this out.

305
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,222
I'm sending you
some e-mail.

306
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,264
[man sighs]

307
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,849
You got it?

308
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,267
What? No.
I got nothin'.

309
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,521
Check it again.
Hit "refresh."

310
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,482
Yeah, Mike,
still nothin'.

311
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,900
Okay, wait a second.

312
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:18,988
I sent it to you
at packer@dunder-mifflin.com

313
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,242
Packaging
at Dunder-Mifflin...

314
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,536
Uh-oh.

315
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,206
Wait. I just got it
from somebody else.

316
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,209
Wow, this is hot.

317
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,169
Damn!

318
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,839
How do I get you
out of this picture?

319
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,598
(Michael)
Ahh...

320
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,350
Darryl!

321
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,227
Hey, hi.

322
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,311
Where's Darryl?

323
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,604
He's, uh,
in the office.

324
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,565
Okay. Hi.

325
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,026
Hey, man,
How's it goin'?

326
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,444
All right.
what's up, Mike?

327
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,946
That's great.
Okay, um.

328
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,115
So did you get an email
from me?

329
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,366
Yeah.
Okay.

330
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,578
Well, that was supposed to
go to Packer,

331
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,912
not "packaging."

332
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,372
Hmm.

333
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,083
Did you already forward it
to a whole bunch of people?

334
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,126
Uh-huh.

335
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,295
Okay. Um...

336
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:19,132
Well, did you get
the second email that I sent,

337
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,925
explaining that the first email
was a mistake

338
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,886
and that you should delete it.
Yep.

339
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,138
And you sent that out
to everyone?

340
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,266
Mike, I'm very busy
down here.

341
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,310
Yikes.

342
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,103
Already sent it
to you, my friend.

343
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,229
Fantastic.

344
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,314
Boring.

345
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,441
Call me
if she rolls over.

346
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,234
Well, at work,

347
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,071
we are not supposed to look at
pictures of women

348
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,989
with lots of skin showing.

349
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,158
That has been made very clear
to me.

350
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,662
But what if the picture is of
your boss?

351
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,957
Then it's work, right?

352
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,459
I guess we'll see.

353
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,877
It's my new screensaver.

354
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,590
Where did you save
the list of exchanges?

355
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,967
I will gladly give you
that information

356
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,511
when my bonus comes through.

357
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,681
I won't be able to do inventory
without it.

358
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,057
Then you won't be able to do
inventory.

359
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,686
Yeah, I really like Stanley.

360
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,397
But I'm not always sure
if he likes me.

361
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,400
I-I guess that's okay.

362
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,069
[whispers]
'Cause I don't really like him.

363
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,530
Hey.

364
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,699
Hey.

365
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,409
You okay?

366
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,451
Yeah.

367
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,911
[coffee pouring]

368
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,206
You sure?

369
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,208
Yeah.

370
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,377
Yes.

371
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:44,968
I'm just in this, like,
stupid fight with Karen.

372
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,386
Oh.

373
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,515
You want to talk about it?

374
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,226
Really?

375
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,274
I have a special assignment
for you.

376
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,651
Who's the target?

377
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:06,072
A sensitive email has been
released to the office.

378
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,241
It contains a file,

379
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:11,119
a picture...

380
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,288
the file name
is "Jamaica Jan Sun Princess."

381
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,539
What's it of?

382
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:15,749
Not important.

383
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,250
Unless you're willing
to tell me everything,

384
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,293
I cannot accept
this assignment.

385
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,045
Okay, forget it.
Okay, I accept it.

386
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,380
[exhales]
Come on. Come on.

387
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,590
Ohh.
Okay.

388
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,217
[sighs] Well, Jan's email
password

389
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,429
is not "Dunder Mifflin,"
"Sandals," "Jamaica,"

390
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,598
"Michael," "Michael Scott,"

391
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,184
"Jan Scott,"
or "Mrs. Jan Scott."

392
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,312
Try "Dwight."

393
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,730
Her password's not gonna be
"Dwight," Dwight.

394
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,608
That's stupid.

395
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,151
Okay.

396
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,281
[ocean waves crashing]

397
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,618
[exhales]

398
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,495
Spider-man--Peter Parker--

399
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,413
would not reveal his love
for Mary Jane

400
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,040
for fear that she might be
captured and harmed

401
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,458
by the Green Goblin.

402
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,169
Now, if Michael had studied
the Spidey principles

403
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,545
that I had drawn up for him,

404
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,340
Jan's boobs might not be all
over the internet.

405
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,760
[makes whooshing sounds]

406
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,679
So, I don't know,

407
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,430
I just feel like we've been
dating a month, right?

408
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,308
Same street--I think
that might be a little close,

409
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,351
a little bit much.

410
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,312
Hmm.

411
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,522
"Hmm," what?

412
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,232
[scoffs]

413
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,443
How far away does she live now,
like, ten minutes?

414
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,322
[sighing]
Yeah, I guess.

415
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:34,202
Honestly, I think you
should go easy on her.

416
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,162
No, I didn't mind helping Jim
with his problem.

417
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,498
That's what friends do.

418
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,501
I...help Phyllis
all the time.

419
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:46,172
Just yesterday I untangled
a piece of tape from her hair.

420
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,550
So...yeah.

421
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,514
Hey.

422
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,850
Thanks a lot.

423
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,853
Oh, don't worry about it.

424
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,396
I mean, it's better

425
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,481
than listening to Michael
play a conch shell,

426
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,650
which is what I was doing.

427
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,697
Oh, also,

428
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,866
Michael went to Jamaica
with Jan.

429
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,201
Yeah. How have we not talked
about this already?

430
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,536
I mean,
what happened there?

431
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,496
Kidnapping?

432
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,582
So your trip to Scottsdale
was good?

433
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:24,419
Oh, yeah.
Arizona's beautiful.

434
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,379
It was great to see my sister.

435
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,548
Mm.
I bet.

436
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,216
Oh, yeah, I know.

437
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,469
I don't normally lay out
in the sun a lot.

438
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,764
But, you know,
when in Scottsdale.

439
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,349
I was visiting my sister and...

440
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,312
(Toby)
Hey, I need to talk to you.

441
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,772
Not now, not ever.

442
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:44,814
About you and Jan.

443
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,566
Ah, none of your business.

444
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,778
Well, I wish that were true,
but it--it, um...

445
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,488
it seems from that photo

446
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,740
that you two--you've entered
into an intimate relationship.

447
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,158
That photo
is my personal property.

448
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,451
And if you are telling me

449
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,911
that you went on my computer
and stole that photo,

450
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,538
then I am going
to call the cops.

451
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,166
Michael, nine different people
emailed me that photo,

452
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,461
including my ex-wife,
and, well, we don't talk.

453
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,546
Well, then this was probably
the ice-breaker you need.

454
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,923
You know,
for your own protection,

455
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,593
you should disclose
the relationship to HR.

456
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,595
I bet you would love
all the details, wouldn't you,

457
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,597
skeevy little perv?

458
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,432
All right, if you're
having a relationship

459
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,934
with your superior,
you must disclose it.

460
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:21,935
No, no.

461
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,478
No, I am not dating Jan.

462
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,897
She was very clear about that.

463
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,900
Just two like souls
having a romantic time

464
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,736
in the most romantic place
on earth.

465
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,446
Got enough, weirdo?

466
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,949
All right.
Thanks, Michael.
Okay.

467
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,660
Okay, we only have 3 hours,
people, to plan a whole luau.

468
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,453
And you're not helping.

469
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,288
What are the ingredients
of poi?

470
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,499
I called every grocery store
in Scranton,

471
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,875
and no one sells whole pigs.

472
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,252
Did you try the petting zoo?

473
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,633
Don't you have some sort of
chaser or gobbler thing

474
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:54,801
that you can send out

475
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,428
that's able to eat up the
other emails?

476
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,389
I read about
something like that.

477
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,433
Well, I am in America,

478
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,809
and I am online,

479
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,352
so I do think it involves you.

480
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:06,813
Uh-huh.

481
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,275
And if I were a subscriber,

482
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,943
would then you be able to send
out the gobbler?

483
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,322
I--
yes, I will hold.

484
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,992
Dunder-Mifflin.
This is Pam.

485
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,660
Just a second.

486
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:21,911
Michael?

487
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,538
It's Jan
on the phone for you.

488
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,373
Oh, no, no, no.

489
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,499
Hang up.
Hang up.

490
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,667
Tell her
I'm not here.

491
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:28,710
Don't.

492
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:29,919
[whispering]
I've ran out of gas.

493
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,338
Hit a deer.

494
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,715
I hit a deer with my car.

495
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,509
Tell her I hit a cat!
Tell her I hit a cat.

496
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:37,844
He'll call you back.

497
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:41,306
Okay.
Great.

498
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,390
Do you think she bought it?

499
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:43,350
Okay.

500
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,685
Okay.

501
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,939
[whispering]
Michael hit a deer?

502
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,026
[inhaling deeply]

503
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,862
[exhales]

504
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,530
People ask me all the time,

505
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:01,534
"Would you rather be blind,
deaf, or can't smell?"

506
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,036
Easy. None of them.

507
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,914
But to me,
most important is smell.

508
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,290
Cocoa butter.

509
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,376
Whole island smelled
like this stuff.

510
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,421
Ohh, mon. That bring
me back to the island.

511
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,052
Michael!

512
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,012
Michael, there's an emergency
in the warehouse.

513
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,597
An accident?
Is somebody hurt?

514
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,517
No, it's...
involves a photograph.

515
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,604
Oh, God, no!
No, no, no, no.

516
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,987
[applause]

517
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,948
Mike, you a rock star, man.

518
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,408
You are the man!

519
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,076
Yeah! Well done.

520
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,078
All right, okay.

521
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,455
That corporate booty,
he likes to hit it!

522
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,506
Hello, hi,
attention, everyone.

523
00:20:56,548 --> 00:21:00,343
Um, apparently there is an
email circulating around

524
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,595
that contains
a very PG-13 rated picture

525
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,556
of me and a woman.

526
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,598
Jan.

527
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,809
No, Kevin, a woman!

528
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:08,893
(Michael)
Maybe Jan, maybe--

529
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,103
Urkel Grue.

530
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,647
My point is that
if you get it,

531
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,567
I would ask that you
just delete it, sight unseen.

532
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,444
Let's be professional,
all right?

533
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,699
Did he actually give you
some ganja?

534
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:24,659
No.

535
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,620
You want some?

536
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,372
When a woman gets older,

537
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:33,126
she'll go just about anywhere
with just about anyone.

538
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,003
I've done some things
I'm not so proud of.

539
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,090
But I've seen the world.

540
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,509
Your body is a temple.

541
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,428
You have to respect it.

542
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,805
You can't just whore it out.

543
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,725
I should be turned on.

544
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,895
But last year, remember I had
that skin cancer scare?

545
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,481
And so now all I can think is

546
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,524
that I hope she was wearing
sunscreen.

547
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:01,112
God, I would love
to rub some on her.

548
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,073
The worst part about the
internet:

549
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,407
when a secret is out,

550
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,493
everyone knows.

551
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,620
The best part
about the internet:

552
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,039
that video of the dancing
Indian midget,

553
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:12,832
crossbow.org,

554
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:17,170
massively multiplayer online
gaming, i.e. EverQuest.

555
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,631
I also enjoy online banking.

556
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,675
Okay, so I went
on the internet,

557
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:22,801
and she's not gonna find

558
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,094
another apartment for that
price.

559
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,136
I mean, this one is twice as
much,

560
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,096
and it doesn't have parking.

561
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,514
Does she like to park?

562
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:28,640
[sighs]
Loves it.

563
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:29,849
Okay.

564
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,143
This one is the same price,

565
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,186
but it's got--

566
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:35,647
Green walls.

567
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,190
I think that's mold.

568
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,984
Ooh, fancy.

569
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,569
[phone ringing]

570
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:45,532
[phone ringing]

571
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:49,661
[phone ringing]

572
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,707
[phone ringing]

573
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,548
* Feelin' *

574
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,925
* Feelin' hot hot hot * *

575
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:05,010
Hey.

576
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,469
Hey.

577
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:07,470
What are you doing
out here?

578
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,723
Island living, you know.

579
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,850
Jan called.

580
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,852
She's coming in later
to talk to you.

581
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,061
Did she say
what it's about?

582
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,688
That's all she said.

583
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:25,947
[gently plays steel drum]

584
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,198

585
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:32,287
* Ole, ole, ole, ole *

586
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,539
* Ole, ole, ole, ole *

587
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,124
* Ole, ole, ole, ole *

588
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,293
* Ole, ole, ole, ole *

589
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,003
* The people in the party
hot, hot, hot *

590
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,967
I wouldn't have come, but I
know Jan is showing up soon.

591
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:49,804
And I don't wanna
miss the show.

592
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,639
Attention, everyone.

593
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,266
May I have your attention,
please?

594
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,976
Listen up.

595
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,062
If we all work
really hard and focus,

596
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,229
we should be out of here
in seven hours.

597
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,981
Now,

598
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:02,067
somewhere in these stacks
I have hidden a deck of cards.

599
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,819
That should motivate you
to keep your eyes open.

600
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:06,613
If you find the deck of cards,

601
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,698
you can redeem it with me in
exchange for a free soft drink.

602
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,824
[card deck zips]

603
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,122
Get back--back to work!

604
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:22,712
Yes, it is Island Luau
Inventory '07.

605
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:24,047
It's actually a success

606
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,049
compared to Disco Audit '05.

607
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,720
Uh, I think
you dropped this.

608
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,559
You sure?
Definitely.

609
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:40,814
I have disconnected
the office T1 line.

610
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:43,108
I've ordered that that
be taken down.

611
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:46,027
And I destroyed all print outs
from the bathroom.

612
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,654
There are copies
in the bathroom?

613
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:49,364
There were.
A lot of them.

614
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:51,574
All right.

615
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,373
Hey, Dwight.

616
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,667
Bet I can stack faster
than you can.

617
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,836
Please.
I can double your pace.

618
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,796
Oh, yeah?

619
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,381
Prove it, champ.

620
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:07,382
You ready?

621
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:08,383
Let's go.

622
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:09,968
One...

623
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,011
two...

624
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,137
three.

625
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,180
Go!

626
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,183
Nice.

627
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:19,728
Get out of my way, Jim!

628
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,062
Jim, move!

629
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,731
Okay.

630
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,650
[both grunting]

631
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:36,953
(Andy)
Dang it!

632
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,329
(Dwight)
Two at a time!

633
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,831
(Andy)
Those aren't straight.
Totally crooked.

634
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,249
Totally crooked.
You're disqualified.

635
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:48,798
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

636
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,217
[boxes clatter]

637
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,095
[groans]

638
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:56,765
(Meredith)
Hello?

639
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,184
I'm stuck.

640
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,352
Anybody?

641
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:06,024
Hey, Stanley.

642
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:09,194
In case I don't see you
again after tonight,

643
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,945
here's your bonus.

644
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,947
$1,000 cash.

645
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,115
Keep the change.

646
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:15,742
There's a butterfly on this.
Why?

647
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:16,993
It is Jamaican.

648
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:19,204
The exchange rate is 65 to 1.

649
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,956
I don't remember
in which direction.

650
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:25,377
So it's either worth 15 bucks
or 65,000.

651
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,004
Yes.
Good luck with that.

652
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,303
I think I owe you one.

653
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,013
Sorry?

654
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,807
For talking sense
into Halpert.

655
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:40,308
The Day's Inn room 228
was starting

656
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,143
to get really depressing.

657
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,311
Oh, yeah, no,
don't worry about it.

658
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,271
I mean,
he was being ridiculous.

659
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:46,356
Yeah.

660
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:48,191
But thanks,
seriously.

661
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,776
Sure.

662
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,409
(Darryl)
Oh, ho, ho, yes!

663
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,786
Yes! What I tell you?

664
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,162
I knew he'd turn up.

665
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:03,748
You see that?

666
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,501
This is the greatest night
of my life.

667
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,004
[crying]

668
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,763
Who did this to you?

669
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,181
Where is he?

670
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:22,350
What?

671
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:24,352
No, it's not...

672
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:25,729
It's nothing.

673
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,866
It's hot in here.

674
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:40,744
Yeah.
Yeah.

675
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,040
[sniffling]

676
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,172
Thanks.

677
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,344
You don't need
to stay here.

678
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,179
I know.

679
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,448
So you're PMSing
pretty bad, huh?

680
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:26,331
You know, I actually lived in
Honolulu for a year.

681
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:29,084
Oh, so you've been
to a real luau.

682
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,044
Yeah.
A few.

683
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:33,546
I tried.
We didn't have time.

684
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,391
What's the problem?

685
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:47,143
We have seven fewer boxes
of canary yellow copier paper

686
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:49,854
in stock
than we're supposed to.

687
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,606
Let me see this.

688
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:54,526
[scanner beeps]

689
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,154
Looks good to me.

690
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:08,123
[scanner beeping]

691
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:14,421
You're a box short on the black
medium-line ballpoints.

692
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,505
I don't know what to tell you.

693
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,345
One year, I had a close
acquaintance of mine

694
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,597
back a truck in here
and clean out this whole place.

695
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,599
That was a very good year.

696
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,518
I think they blamed it
on some kid.

697
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:31,521
[drum clangs]

698
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,291
(Jan)
Hello, everyone.

699
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,334
Hello, Michael.

700
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,376
[muffled]
Hello.

701
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:55,003
Hi, Jan.

702
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:57,672
You look...tan.

703
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:01,426
I was in Scottsdale
visiting my sister.

704
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,136
Yeah?

705
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:05,472
How was it?

706
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:07,182
Very sunny.

707
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:10,685
Family's important.

708
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,688
Michael, I would like to speak
with you in your office.

709
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,106
Okay, yep.
Please.

710
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:53,061
Why am I here, Michael?

711
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:55,188
Uh...

712
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,023
In the last year I've gone
through a divorce,

713
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:00,652
an identity theft,
a husband who would not...

714
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:02,445
communicate.

715
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:03,613
This is neither here
nor there.

716
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,031
My psychiatrist thinks
that I have

717
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,741
some self-destructive
tendencies.

718
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:09,661
And that for once,
I should indulge them.

719
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:11,413
You following me?

720
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:13,623
Uh, uh, yes.

721
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:16,710
I think I owe it
to myself

722
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:19,170
to find some kind
of happiness.

723
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:22,590
You know, I mean,
even if it means

724
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:26,594
lowering my expectations
or redefining the word itself.

725
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:28,096
Okay, yeah.

726
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:29,431
This is the thing,
you know.

727
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:33,309
I am attracted to you.

728
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,770
I-I don't know why I...

729
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,356
[sighing]
But I am.

730
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:42,027
And...I need to follow
my instincts.

731
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,112
At least, that's
what Dr. Perry thinks.

732
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:46,489
Who's Dr. Perry?

733
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:49,075
This is the point, okay?

734
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:50,285
You're wrong for me.

735
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,037
Okay.

736
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:55,165
In...in every way.

737
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:57,792
Well, not--

738
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:01,296
But I still find myself
wanting to...

739
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:05,592
Be with you.

740
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:11,139
And I, to you,

741
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:14,642
in addition, feel

742
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:18,730
the same feelings
that you are as well.

743
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:27,238
Good, good.

744
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,497
So, um, thanks
for coming by.

745
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:36,456
So, I, uh...

746
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:38,166
No, good.

747
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,710
Okay.
Okay.

748
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:43,380
Thank you for taking
the time.

749
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:44,673
Well, thanks
for coming over, I appre--

750
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:46,591
Mm.

751
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:53,556
Wait 15 minutes,
find an excuse,

752
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:54,849
and meet me
at your condo.

753
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:56,393
Okay.

754
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:01,856
Jan.

755
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:04,609
You complete me.

756
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:12,242
Oh, God.

757
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:20,583
Hey.

758
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,253
Remember when we were planning
our honeymoon,

759
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:25,171
and you wanted to go
to Hawaii,

760
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:27,215
and I wanted to go
to Mexico?

761
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:29,384
Yeah.

762
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:32,554
I was definitely right.

763
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:40,437
Oh, brother.

764
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:44,774
What am I gonna do?

765
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:47,610
I'm gonna hang it up
at home.

766
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,821
I don't have a lot
of art.

767
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:00,957
(Meredith)
I'm back here!

768
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,419
I'm stuck!
Hey!

769
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:06,588
You gotta be kidding me.
