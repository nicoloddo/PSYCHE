It is a command line tool.

to validate:
mfa validate ./interspeech_assai english_us_arpa english_us_arpa --single_speaker

Even if it doesnt validate because of errors during training, continue with the alignment: the training is done as a backup and is not strictly necessary, it usually fails because of the length of the audios.


to align:
mfa align ./interspeech_assai english_us_arpa english_us_arpa ./aligned_assai --single_speaker --output_format json

I modified the code: line 2430 of multiprocessing.py to avoid exiting the application on a collision error. You can also find it searching for "nico"
